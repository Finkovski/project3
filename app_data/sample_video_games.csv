"I hated the first game but absolutely love this one!!  Having a ball running all over San Fran.  Marcus is an engaging protaganist and the voice acting is great.  Side quests are kind of repetitive but still fun.  Love the varied vehicles, outfits, hidden treasures, the crazy population (topless dancers and bums wearing garbage bags to name a few) and the gorgeous scenery.  Way better than Watchdogs 1.  I'm starting on my second playthrough after downloading some extra DLC.",5.0,B01GKF7T9S,Don't let Watchdogs 1 Deter You - this game is GREAT!,Video Games

"True to it's developer's (Blizzard) reputation, this game is simply the best in its genre.  Starcraft 2 will keep you occupied for months on end.  The single-player campaign is excellent and offers both a great storyline as well as an excellent user interface.  Back that up with a comprehensive multi-player component (battle.net) which offers very competitive play, an excellent achievement system, and a solid social gaming structure, and you're golden.

I've honestly logged hundreds of hours in playing Starcraft 2 and am looking forward to the many more to come.  :P",5.0,B000ZKA0J6,Nothing but the best,Video Games

"Light and dark play a key role in Remedy's long awaited Alan Wake.  While at no point did I find Alan Wake to be all that scary, what I did find was a good story, combined with some great action sequences.  Unfortunately these action sequences do begin to feel a little repetitive and the facial modeling and animation of the characters are not very good looking.  It's not perfect, but it stands alone as a pretty unique thriller.

Dark and Light:

I shall try to keep this review free of spoilers, but I may let a few through just to warn you.  The basic premise of the game is that you are Alan Wake, a struggling author who is on a trip to Bright Falls, a sleepy town in the pacific northwest to try and get inspiration for your next novel.  Before you know it Wake and his wife become embroiled in what looks like one of Wake's novels come to life.  The story is pretty good, with a fair amount of twists and turns.  Best of all it's presented in an episodic format so it feels a lot like a TV show, like the Twilight Zone.  You'll spend most of the game at night fighting your way through the ""Taken"", which appear to be supernatural, dark representations of people living in Bright Falls.  Wake's wife is taken in the beginning of the game and you'll spend the game trying to get her back and trying understand the mystery of Bright Falls, all the while wondering if Wake is just crazy.  Central to the game is the theme of dark and light, with light from your flashlight being your primary weapon against the dark things in the night.

Additionally, other sources of light serve as safe zones and additional weapons, but most of the time you will be using a flashlight to destroy the taken's shield of darkness and then a conventional gun to finish them off.  Most of the game plays out as a third person shooter, but occasionally you will also get to use a car or truck.  Controls for the vehicles sometimes feel a little sluggish, but they get the job done.  Otherwise the control is pretty typical for an over the shoulder third person shooter.  Fighting the taken is fun and satisfying, and can get pretty hairy sometimes.  I would say the challenge is decent, but not much more so than any other TPS.

An Audio/Visual Feast, for the Most Part:

The lighting effects in Alan Wake are great and for the most part the game looks great.  The way the light of your flashlight affects the appearance of the environment is fairly striking, and in these moments I feel like it is one of the best looking games on the 360.  The inky blackness of the night surrounding the few light sources in the game, combined with patches of fog really sell the chilling, isolated atmosphere of the game.  The game really falls apart visually when you look at the characters' faces however.  The facial detail and appearance of the characters looks horrible.  The facial animation is not that great either.  I expected more from a story based game released in 2010, and it seriously impacts an otherwise very engrossing experience.  The audio component is just fine though music is moody and very fitting.  Voice acting is pretty well done and the sound effects are engaging.  From the sizzle of light hitting the taken to the swirling woosh noise as a new wave of taken attacks, the sound is pretty much spot on.

Haven't I Seen This Before?:

The game's biggest fault for me was that the environments aren't varied enough.  I've read other reviews that have said similar things and I must agree.  While the set pieces are good looking and moody in atmosphere, they all start to blend together in the middle of the game.  The logging camps and outbuildings all start to look the same.  I suppose this can't be helped too much given the setting of a small logging town, and to be fair it is broken up nicely by some genuinely interesting parts, such as the power plant.  This combined with the fact that you fight largely the  same taken enemies over and over lends a certain repetitious feeling to the game.  This and the jarring facial modeling was enough for me to detract a star from an otherwise good game.

Bottom Line:

Visuals:  Spectacular lighting effects and moody atmosphere make most of the game a visual treat, but are offset by some repetition of elements in the game and some pretty poor facial modeling, which is a big issue in a game centered around character and story.

Audio: The sound is great and the voice acting believable.  Many great rumbling 'poltergeist' style moments lend authenticity to the enemies in the game.

Gameplay:  The controls are solid and the action is fun and blowing away the taken is great fun.  The game suffers, however, from a lack of diverse enemies and fighting the same taken over and over gets a little too repetitive.

Story: The story is pretty good with plenty of moments when you wonder if this stuff is really happening to Wake or if he's just going crazy.  The ending is great, just don't expect it to explain everything.

Overall:  Good game start to finish, but it suffers in a lack of diversity in enemies and environments and some of the poorest facial modeling I've seen in a big title in a long time.",4.0,B0010AYJXI,A Good Supernatural Thriller,Video Games
"Much better environments this time around! The first Splinter Cell was pretty much 95% indoors. This one has more open & outdoor environments.

The original one Nintendo created really takes the cake over anything else. ALthough there are better ones from third-party companies at about a few dollars higher than Nintendo, it is definitely the original Memory Card 251 that really takes the cake, with 4x the memory storage than the original memory card Nintendo created when the Gamecube was released back in 2001.

"A word of warning: If you want to play titles for the original Xbox such as Halo 2, your system MUST have an official Xbox-branded hard drive. That's why their drive costs more, it contains a partition that allows the old games to be played. I found this out the hard way, and now I'm trying to find a solution that involved needing to get the transfer cable and hook the HDD up to my computer, partition it, put some software mods onto it so that it will be backwards compatible, blah blah blah.

If you don't want to play old games, it's great. fits right into the Slim and works very nicely.

UPDATE: If you get the proper transfer cable and download some software to your computer, you can hook this up to your computer and modify the drive by adding the partition to play original Xbox discs. I successfully got my system to play Halo 2, but it was kind of a pain and I had to go buy the USB-to-SATA cable. So if you like to ""hack"" stuff, save a few bucks and mod the drive yourself, there are YouTube videos on how to do it.

"Everyone seems to complain about these controllers being difficult to use, I can see that being true if a person is younger than 18. I am 21, and my hands perfectly fit it. Oddly enough, because it only fits in the hands of older people, it is very durable and heavy! So it cannot bend or break easily. As for the controller itself, it has six buttons, red, blue, yellow, green, black and white, along with two very unique triggers! Rather than an L + R button at the top of the controller which wear out easy, these triggers are spring loaded so they should last very long! There are two ports for additional memory cards, but with the X-Box having a huge memory you should never need a memory card. There are two analog sticks at the top let and bottom right of the controller for shooting games. It also has a normal directional pad at the bottom left for very accurate control. It comes with a rumble function and it works by a USB port, and for those of you that are not computer nerds, that means that plug it into the X-Box and its self powered, so you do not need batteries for the rumble function.",4.0,B00005O0I7,"No L + R buttons, made for adults, very durrable",Video Games
"First, I must admit that I've been along time fan of the Madden series and have alot of respect for it.  Madden 2004 is a great game, BUT is no where near ESPN Football.
This game is loaded and was very well thought out from the ground up.  The running game is fantastic, and I love how you can charge your player up for a super move.  It takes some pretty good timeing to get used to, however its fun and sometimes effective.  Should we even mention the passing?  It's awesome.  I love having the ability to check out the defensive formation, see who is going to have one on one coverage and try and exploit the weakness its awesome.  Oh, yeah and its also nice knowing that the computer on offense or defense is not going to auto adjust its-self to counter act what ever play you pick.  And lastly there is the defense end of things.  Gang tackling is a must and is very incouraged.  However the ability to read what the offense is doing or what you think they are doing, just adds so much realism.
Next, I would like to mention the presentation.  The graphics are almost perfect.  The cheerleaders actually shake there money makers.  And your fans go crazy, with face paint, signs, the whole 9 yards.  Not to mention the half time summary is truly amazing.  And then there are the instant replays WOW!!
Oh, my and then there is audio.  The crowd ambience, music playing on the pa, the players constantly punking each other out.  Some times calling the QB or HB by there first names.
This game is by far the best football game I have ever played.  We have weekly touranments in the dorm, and it doesnt matter if you are playing or not, people still come and watch.  This game is exciting, the graphics are outstanding, and the sound is out of this world.

1) Awesome gameplay - camera angles aren't bad, but the shoulder buttons help
2) Plot - one of my favorite plots (up there with Resident Evil 4) and music in the game is great
3) Difficulty - some of the puzzles take a little figuring out, but aren't ""God of War"" difficult (in my opinion).  Fighting enemies can seem daunting, but you can ""level up"" in other worlds

"I really have no idea why this game is so compelling.  All you really do is drive a truck.  Sure, there are additional things to do like by garages, hire drivers, expand your fleet, etc, but this game is all about the driving.  And it does that really, really well.

For a game released in 2013, the graphics aren't really anything to write home about.  It looks like a PS3 game released in 2009.  It's not a bad thing, just a thing.  I assume this is because the developers are an independent studio without the resources of a developer with publisher backing.  Don't expect great textures, but again, you don't need them.

The driving is really, really fun.  I really don't know why.  You just drive.  Pick a job off the job board and drive.  All the jobs require you haul some specific product or resource from point A to point B.  You can gain extra XP by transporting fragile or explosive payloads.  You also have to drive carefully.  Failure to follow the rules of the road will result in penalties and/or fines.  You better turn your lights at night, signal when you turn and drive on the correct side of the road.  If you don't, you'll pay the price.

Honestly, it's not a game I can marathon because it's fairly repetitive; but I love sitting down for 30 minutes and completing 3-4 jobs, earning a little money and making sure my driving team is keeping busy.  I also think the menus could be a bit more friendly.  They can be tricky to navigate, in my opinion.

Yes, the game is playable on keyboard and XBox 360 controller, but I suspect a wheel is really the way to go.  I've not played with a wheel, but I'm doing just fine with a controller and some minor tweaking.

Kudos the developers for creating a compelling game.  It goes on sale fairly often, so pick it up and drive.",5.0,B006NU6F28,Strangely compelling.,Video Games

"How many DDR games can they make? DDRX brings a new, urban video-based look to the DDR game, but in the end it really comes down to if you enjoy the songs and dancing to them.

I have five DDR games and I have an area of my basement set up with the PS2, the pile of games and the dance pad. I don't tend to play ""one game"" (in terms of DDR). If I head downstairs to dance, I play a few songs on one game, swap games, play a few songs on the next one and so on. I get a lot of chances to compare them all against each other, the benefits and downsides of each one.

DDR X is certainly shinier than the other games. They are pushing the PS2 to its limits with the graphics here. Really, though, who is watching the graphics when they are dancing? Yes, I love having the treadmill-dancing video running for OK Go (and missed half the steps the first time I danced it because I was having so much fun watching the video). Which sort of proves my point - if you are watching or paying attention to anything other than the arrows, you'll be in trouble :)

Since the arrows really don't change from game to game, all that really matters is the song list. This is a VERY subjective judgment. We all have quite different musical tastes. For example, in DDR X there are four songs I really like - and I'm not really fond of the others. I'm sure other players will have a completely separate list of songs in this game they adore. That's why it's nice to have so many options in the game, so that you can pick out the ones you like and ignore the ones you don't like.

I'm really glad they continue to come out with games for the PS2 to continue out the DDR game line. I like the steps and songs in my various DDR games and am always glad to be able to add more games into my workout mix. I'm sure at some point with the PS3 they'll come out with a DDR that lets you download songs and old step sets from the old DDR games, and at that point I might convert up to the PS3. In the meantime, though, this is a great option. I definitely recommend anyone who wants to get a good balance and cardio workout to look into DDR, look at the song set list for each one and choose a few that you enjoy. DDR isn't about just having one and playing only it all the time. It's about having a few, with songs you like, and enjoying the songs.

DDRX is definitely a great addition to the library. Well recommended.",5.0,B0019SMCDU,Fun New Songs for a Great Game,Video Games

"So I mark Warcraft III as the point where the franchise stopped being WARcraft, and became MAGEcraft, or Magiccraft, or some stupid snippy pun regarding a favor towards magic rather than war.

And don't worry, this negative review isn't all just about the visceral hatred of high fantasy involving lots of magic.  The game itself has plenty of bad flaws.

I used to love Warcraft. But I hate Warcraft since they made it ""Blizzard presents: Magic: The Gathering"".

My favorite thing about Warcraft was exactly what they took out in III and World of: a sense of grittiness and uniqueness in a world of fantasy. There were no ""Thyalawynd"" or ""Darkheart""s or ""Ebonheart""s or ""Gyilwind""s magic fantasy crap with gravity-defying robes and swords made of silver and no shields or any semblence of tactics or strategy or even blood.

There was no ""We ah the Knoights of Lothar the Guilywind, son of Gunther the Loinhearted, son of Baxter the Baxton, son of Aragorn of Aragorn, and we foight fo peeeeeace"" versus ""Graarrgh we are demon spawns from hell who want to crush the world and kill everything that moves"".

Warcraft wasn't like that at all---Warcraft had the Orcs coming into Azeroth because their own world was destroyed by civil war, and rather than accomodate, the Humans responded with war. And it blew up in their faces as the Orcs destroyed Stormwind Keep and forced the humans into Lothleroin, with the Orcs following. I don't remember what happened after that, but I think eventually the Orcs were beaten back by the Alliance of Humans and Elves.

Then I completely do not remember a single thing about Warcraft III other than Taurens supporting the Orcs for absolutely no reason, and the Undead randomly appearing out of nowhere for no reason, and Night Elves appearing out of nowhere for no reason, and lots of pixie dust sprinkle winds magic and demons and wizards and keys and powerups and upgrades and magical fire pansy moves of doom for make benefit glorious magician of kingdom of Godwynn EverNeverwind P. Dark-Ebonheart.

Warcraft and Warcraft II were to me, the modern Medieval-fantasy equivalent of Conan the Barbarian, in that yes, magic was there, and magic was used, but only the magicians practiced magic, and the magicians could not stand up to an army of a billion Orc Grunts and Troll Axethrowers.  Sure, then there came Ogre-Mages, Death Knights, Paladins, and the like, but even those were but a small asset in an army made to fight with steel and wood and flesh, not just magic.

Instead in Warcraft III, and extending into World of Warcraft, magic becomes the centerpoint of virtually any army.  You can still use the backbone of infantry and cavalry and the like, but their effectiveness against magical heroes and magical elves and pixies is reduced by the sudden jump in population everything costs and the stupid upkeep.

But while magic would become the more central point beyond Warcraft III, War3's focus instead came upon HEROES!

The entire RTS aspect of this game is not fully broken, but rather fractured by not just the inclusion, but the heavy reliance upon individual heroes, who have dozens of hero-only chests to pick up for upgrades and equipment that can make them MORE powerful, and they have the ability to LEVEL UP and research MORE abilities and powers.

At least half the missions in the campaign I was apart of either involved playing ONLY as heroes, or playing in such a mission that only heroes could determine the outcome of battles.

Then, UPKEEP.

The idea of upkeep in this game is in no way relevant to how upkeep really works in games like Total War or in real life.  Upkeep is the cost of maintaining an army.  Upkeep does not exist in traditional RTS games.

In this game, upkeep means ""you no longer mine as many resources"" when you have too many units.  And ""too many"" ranges from 50-75 population points taken up.

And then comes the fact that full-army battles are rendered impossible when the average Orc Grunt starts costing THREE population points, and the maximum population is no longer the Blizzard standard of 200, but somewhere near 125-175 or so.

Controlling the first level of upkeep means your peasants now gather 7 of a resource rather than ten.  Medium upkeep reduces it to 5.  High upkeep reduces it to 3.  And an army under high upkeep can consist of a handful of heavy units not fit to take out a militia force twice their size.

This is only balanced by the fact that it affects all player on a map.  But another problem involving this is that because the basic units take up so much population and are so ineffective, the player is basically forced into an arm's race with their opponents, to build up their base technologies, upgrade all they can, then build the most powerful units available while ignoring the 90% of other units available to train, just to meet an evenly matched opponent who has done the same thing.

And then again, the RTS idea is fractured and shattered by the powerful emphasis on building superunits and superweapons as quickly as possible, and to hell with all other available units.

This is not how a good RTS works.  Starcraft comes to mind: an army of 30 basic Terran Marines can slaughter an enemy army of Hydralisks or Ultralisks.  An army of 30 Battlecruisers seems unstoppable, and yet can easily be torn asunder by a few Corsairs or Valkyries, or a flood of Scourges.  Or they can be broken up from all-out attack from an Arbiter's stasis, or a Ghost's lockdown.  They can suffer huge splash damage from Psionic Storms from High Templar or Infested Kerrigan.

In short, in Starcraft, every unit is effective if utilized properly.  You can win one game by playing a megalomaniac and massing dozens of super units, and win another game in the same amount of time with a ragtag militia and some special tricks of infiltration and the like.

Warcraft III has none of it.  Every unit that is not a superunit or a hero is simply cannon fodder and/or base defense until that superunit or hero is available for building.

And so what was once ""WARcraft"" and I so deridingly called ""Magecraft"" could more accurately be called ""Herocraft"", because heroes are so ridiculously overpowered that they become the center point of every game, EVEN the skirmishes, as you cannot start unless you pick a hero for your side.  AND you can get MORE THAN ONE hero on a map, one for heavy combat, one for support, and one for magic.",1.0,B00005V9Q1,Where it stopped being Warcraft,Video Games

"I just got done with this game at 1:01 a.m on Feb. 13 I honestly have to say there was great potential for this game as an A L I E N fan I am extreamly dissapointed with GearBox, it felt as if they just sat around and didn't give a rats ass about us A L I E N fans and just wanted our money then laugh at us like this whole thing was a big sick joke, there was only two extremly suspensful scenes where your running away from a new breed of Xenomorph called Raven sealing off doors trying to figure out what way to go then you start to panic then go into the air vents then after a short while there was another scene where you are walking through the sewers lights are flashing and the only thing you see is a deformed alien walking towards you when you make a sound also this game has a couple of places that is most recongnizable from the ALIENS movie like the scene where newt and riply fought off the facehugger to the most famous scene off of the alien franchis the space jockey. This game  has the worst looking graphics known to date the lighting looks bland and the textures are very dull aswell as the humans they didn't even look realistic even the animation was really bad now the voice acting was good so as the Alien enviroments to the aliens themselve's but the animation was just disgusting.

"Let me first say that this game sucks. First, the loading in this game is rediculous. It takes 20 hours to load everything! The story mode is kind of numb, and i really hate the fact that you can't buy superstar points in the shop. if you're like me, you like to create a lot of characters, and, if you're like me, you like to copy your best superstar, then edit the copied one so you can have a new superstar with a good rating. Basically, you can't change their weight class when creating a new character off a copied one, to reset the attributes, so you can change them up. The create mode is really lame. The clothing sucks so bad in this game. My best friend's name is David and they don't even have that as a superstar calling name when you enter the ring like they did in the last one. Last time I checked, David is a pretty popular first name. Hell, it's Batista's first name.

Like all wrestling games, it does have a degree of fun- a very SMALL degree of fun. but this game is really really lame, and I find it hard to believe that people are saying it's ""a turning point in smackdown history."" how the hell do you figure? seriously. did you ever play the other games? you can't sit there and say it's the best of the smackdown games, because if you do, you must have never played another smackdown game. If you create a character, and, for example, you make them from Las Vegas Nevada, the announcer will say ""On the way to the ring, from Las Vegas Nevada, from Nevada..."" Why the hell are they saying the state twice? Make anyone from a city and state and when they are introduced, the announcer says the state twice.

There are so many damn glitches in this game, it's unbelievable. You have to be a damn cruiserweight to be a luchadore or martial arts?! That's pretty lame. Anyone remember Nathan Jones or Steve Blackman??? Both martial artists and Blackman was a heavyweight and Jones was a super heavyweight.

Story mode sucks. All I am gonna say. Music in the game is better, except for that one damn Money in the Bank song, which is probably THE worst song ever recorded.

Also, where the hell is Paul London? Sure, we have 4 friggon Mick Foley's, but no Paul Lundon or, as gay as they are, the Spirit Squad. They really screwed this game up in every way possible. They really rushed this game. All the little 10 year olds who like this game have no clue about any other WWE game, I can assure you, because this game sucks big time. There are barely any grapple moves!! WTF???? How can anyone sit there, after plaing the other WWE games, and say it is a good game? This game is utter crap! I brought it back within 5 days of getting it.

The heights in this game are all off. i put a wrestler at 5'7"" and he was as tall as Angle... Angle is 6'2""! I have played every wwe game, and have been a fan of the wwe (wwf) since the early 80's. This game sucks plain and simple. They rushed it. Just like Mortal Kombat Armageddon.

"I got this Xbox one bundle from GameStop two years ago, and I am still amazed by it.  Initially I purchased a couple games, but since I started downloading all the ""free"" Games With Gold (Gold Membership is anywhere from $35-$50), and discovered EA Access ($50 per year), I have more games than I will be able to play before this console is retired in a few years.
I really like the Kinect features for menu navigation and voice commands, but don't really use it in any games.
Due to the available entertainment and streaming apps through Xbox Live, and borrowed accounts from family, I have cut the cord with cable and never looked back.  I would never have done this without the ease of the Xbox.  That has saved me about $200 per month, so you could make the case that it has paid for itself.

The only major complaint I have about this bundle is the quality of the headset it comes with. Xbox would have blown PS4 Away if they would have packaged a quality headset with this bundle, but overall it's been well worth the expense.",5.0,B00NFXOQW2,Thank you Microsoft,Video Games
"Let me say that the Multiplayer mode had me hooked right away. The role playing game aspects of experience leading to new abilities and new weapons is really addicting as the leveling up is not tedious in the early levels and really addicting as you bring new weapons into play. Basically as you progress through the multiplayer game you have experience affecting your rank and personal abilities, along with unlocking new sets of challenges. Challenges are ways of increasing rank more quickly as you get experience bonuses for accomplishing a challenge. One challenge would be to kill 5 enemies while in the crouched position or perhaps to call in 5 UAVs. Then there are also specific challenges associated with each weapon in the game. By completing these challenges, you not only get experience but you can acquire new camouflage for the guns or new scopes and capabilities.

So multiplayer aside, there is a great single player campaign here as well, but it is missing a multiplayer coop mode that would have made this absolutely stellar. The single player campaign puts you in the shoes of 3 separate soldiers with specific objectives to meet. The missions are well scripted (much to the same degree that the missions in Halo 3 or other Call of Duty games are well scripted), the story is well told and missions range from easy to fun to challenging without getting to terribly annoying. I ran through the game on Hardened difficulty and really got stuck in only a couple of places where I spent ungodly amounts of reloads attempting to accomplish the mission. But the ending is satisfying and spectacular and very anti-climatic.

So based on this, the multiplayer aspects alone would warrant getting this game, but add in a fun, exciting (~6 hours) single player mode and I think we have a winner.",5.0,B000TG530M,Great Multiplayer.  Great short single player,Video Games

"Mouse looks great, and worked great for a few hours once I got it.
No problems installing driver (windows automatically did this without issue).

However, after about a half a day of usage, it started to ""stick"" and ""stutter"" with use.
The DPI switch did work and had a noticeable effect, however, this coupled with the sticking and stutter issue of the mouse made it unusable.
I ended up returning this for a refund.

The buttons feel and work great, the lighting effect is a nice touch.
Even with the weight tuning set fully loaded, this is a LIGHT mouse. However, it does not feel cheap.

"If you ever find the opportunity to buy this game, you should certainly do so.  ICO provides a unique and unparalleled gameplay experience all wrapped up in a moody and atmospheric setting.

Here's basically how it works:  you play as a young, horned boy named Ico.  You've been banished from your home village and offered up as sacrifice, due to what is implied to be a curse of sorts.  But a stroke of luck gives you the perfect chance to escape.  On your way out, you find Yorda, trapped in a cage dangling several stories from the ground.  While you cannot communicate with her through words (both characters speak different non-existent languages), you still feel compelled to save this alluring young lady.

In order to achieve your escape, and that of Yorda, you must pull her around by her arm (or in some cases, call her to follow you) and guide her through puzzles and obstacles through environmental manipulation, while overcoming well-thought-out and clever platforming tasks to do this.  You must also use simple but fun combat techniques to keep the evil shadows from pulling poor Yorda into a dark portal, thus ending the game.

Sound boring?  Well, it's really not.  Read on!

While most games that require you to lug an extra character around tend to be bothersome and tedious, there is something so gratifying about tugging Yorda around the gloom-and-doom castle in which this one-of-a-kind fairy tale takes place.

With every intricate puzzle, you will have ""ah-ha!"" moments, and ""huh?"" moments, and sometimes you will even get ""wow!"" moments.  Few games have provoked so much response from me as a gamer, and anyone looking to connect emotionally with the on-screen character (or in this case, characters), would be a fool not to play this game.

Some gamers complain about the brevity of this adventure, but I am compelled to disagree:  the game is simplistic in nature.  If it were any longer, it might have seemed a bit...excess.  I won't say I wouldn't have appreciated more length to the game, but at the same time, when all was said and done and I was faced with the finale (which is, by the way, very fitting), I didn't feel cheated.  I felt like I had experienced something very special and now I was fortunate enough to go and tell others about it!

I wholeheartedly recommend this fantastic work of art, and I hope it finds its way into your hearts and into your PS2s very soon, if it has not already.",5.0,B00004YUWA,Unique and fun experience!,Video Games

"Mega Man fans have had it tough over the last few years, with the obvious decline of the original Mega Man series and the once great Mega Man X series (although Mega Man X Command Mission was one of the more recent brighter spots).

To me, Mega Man Zero is an attempt by Capcom to resurrect the classic Mega Man X gameplay that was lost soon after Mega Man X4. After X4, the series began to seriously suffer as it seemed Capcom just made sequels just for the sake of making them.

Mega Man Zero is a many ways a sucess, but at the same time is not. On the plus side, I was very pleased with the inclusion of many RPG-like elements that the game employs, such as the leveling up of weapons and how crystals act as experence points for the cyber-elves. The addition of an elemental damage system is also another high point (even if it makes some battles pathetically easy). In lacing the game with RPG elements (like they did in Mega Man Legends), Capcom has added a whole new layer to the gameplay.

The inclusion of different weapons was also nice, as you could change your weapon on the fly to adjust for certain situations. The fact you no longer gain abilties from enemy bosses isn't such a problem due to this.

Unfourtately, Mega Man Zero falls short in many categores. The fact you cannot revist many of the games locations once they are completed is very troubling - if you miss a cyber-elf in a non-revisitable area you are out of luck (and your going to have to play it again). This means you must know where everthing is and thus takes bite out the exploration factor that Mega Man games are known for.

While the RPG-like cyber-elf system is a very nice change, but many of the elves crystal requirements are simply too large. You'll easily double your playing time trying to get them all to the higest level (unless you cheat - and you shouldn't - as cheating is wrong! lol). Some of the elves are also too powerful (the one that removes all the spikes from the game is so cheap it isn't even funny).

Mega Man Zero also ditches the tired and true ""stage"" system that is used in practically every other Mega Man game. While this too is nice change, the fact many places aren't accessible later in the game and many of the places look nearly identicle (and very drab looking as well), it proves that the tired and true stage method is much better.

Storywise, the game is really nothing special. Even with the use of many story screen stillshots and the useage of more dialogue than one would usually find in a Mega Man game, one will find Capcom did more with less in the past Mega Man X games.

Mega Man Zero is a good addition to the Mega Man universe, but one has to wonder how many sequels Capcom will have to make before this series starts to crumble and wither like the other  series (especially when your pumping out a sequel every year). Will the Mega Man Zero series survive Capcom's habit of smashing their game series with ""the sequel shovel""?

"One of the best games I have ever played. Heartbreakingly memorable and touching, and I mean that. There is some truly innovative game play and for once you really feel for the characters you play.

Story: Somewhere in a medieval, fantasy world, a young family is besot by tragedy. When the father turns very ill, the two children of the family (brothers) go on a perilous quest to a find way to cure their parent. Along their journey they meet amazing creatures and people who help them.

Game play: Using one controller (you can also use a keyboard if on PC) you move two characters. I was afraid it would feel unnatural or be difficult to move both characters at once but it wasn't. After a while it seemed natural. The game is mostly puzzle solving with a few boss fights but don't expect to be picking up weapons. You use intelligence and skills to make your way across the world.

Who should play: There are some heartbreaking moments in this game and a few frightening images. I would say a twelve year old could handle it but I would be wary of kids younger than ten playing it. Why........

(SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS) We come across some horrific scenes. A women drowns, a man hangs himself (you try to stop him, I wasn't able to ) and in a dark forest a group of children (?) are hanging. These are few and far between but because we can't understand the language being spoken by the characters we have no way of knowing what kind of war is going on. We just feel the danger. Many lighter moments balance out these scenes but they foretell the ending to come. So parents, be careful. Older folks, you can handle this I be thinking ;)  (END OF SPOILERS).

You can easily play this game in a long evening or afternoon. Its a beautiful, sad but completely amazing game and you should play it.

I bought the game code and played it through steam on my Surface Pro 2 with an Xbox 360 controller. I had NO problems downloading or playing. I had NO glitches or freezes. Honestly, this was the easiest game I've ever downloaded and played.

"People kept telling me to purchase the Nyko charger but after a few weeks we realized it was defective and NOT how we were using it.

The left charger station NEVER worked properly and the pins looked fine.  People kept saying it was us but I beg to differ.  Even their support NEVER responded to our calls and emails.  NEVER!

Then we checked and found these guys.  The InCharge Station will astound you.  We already bought one and after a few weeks realized we should have two.  After all, we have 4 wii-motes :-)

But alas none were available on Amazon or anywhere else it was advertised.  So I emailed the companies sales asking what was going on.  They were awesome!

I received an email from their sales (name withheld) saying they sold out everywhere and were working hard to get them back out there.  If I didn't have one in two weeks to call him directly and he's take care of me.

About two weeks later I learned Amazon had them again and purchased it as fast as I could.  We couldn't be happier.  This charger does just the job and does it better than the Nyko.  Not just in reliability BUT also in battery life.  The Nyko would always run out of juice quickly.  Usually within several hours however the InCharge was still going strong and was quickly recharged compared to the Nyko.

"When purchasing Manhunt 2 realize that it was modified after being threatened with an Adults Only rating - meaning that the executions (one of the largest and most time consuming/exciting elements of the game) are censored with a strange blurring/coloring effect. This blurring effect gets really old, really fast especially when it completely masks everything that's happening and it is obviously an out of place tacked on addition; it's not enough to break the game, but it most definitely takes away from the experience (there's not much to be horrified or disturbed by except the executions - well that and perhaps the language and bondage themes). The graphics are great, and the rest of the game is executed nicely - mission areas are well developed, they load fast, there are interesting obstacles and 'puzzles' (very minor) to overcome as you move along. The AI is decent, though one wonders what kinds of shadows there are in the world of Manhunt 2, even while being thankful for their amazing powers of deception. The NPCs also say all sorts of funny things - they're not comedians but you will definitely get a kick out of the things they say.

You have several feedback tools including alertness levels, noise meter and radar (based off of line of sight and noise - it's not a freebie). Your view is a little restricted, but since the emphasis is on using your environment and stealth effectively (i.e. you'll have time to look around from shadows and such - usually - and plan your next move) it's not a big deal. The environments are interesting and well done, complete with plenty of action beyond the player's area, simply to create an immersive experience. The game saves at checkpoints automatically allowing you to progress quickly and without interruptions.

If you have the patients and interest in a horror survival game that focuses on killing in a real world setting as opposed to simply surviving or monsters and such then this is a great PSP game for you. The game recommends playing with earphones, and it truly is a better experience this way - the sound effects are pretty good throughout (and the expletives are there throughout as well).
This game is not (in my opinion) particularly scary, though it does have a wonderfully dark environment and emphasis, even if the story is somewhat lacking in intensity.

This game is over the top, it's fun and it's unfortunately hampered by the fact that Rockstar Games was threatened with an AO rating. Thankfully it's still fun to play - so good luck Danny.",4.0,B000NIJ35C,Interesting Horror Game,Video Games
"This is a wonderful collection. Though to my understanding, it isn't exactly worth the price tag. My favorite part is Aqua's sequence, where it's like a tech demo of the upcoming Kingdom Hearts III, though with the gameplay similar to that of Aqua's playthrough on Birth By Sleep.
Now, I'm not a die-hard fan of Kingdom Hearts, I'm a fan. I know of the story mostly, but it's too complex. The small thing I dislike in the KH series is that they always reflect back to the younger Sora and Riku from the images of the first KH. They annoy me. Since Dream Drop Distance was portrayed after KH II, would it of been so difficult to have the older Sora in it, and take out the whole ""Command Deck""? KH I & II is the most popular because they don't have complications with their gameplay, same with Birth By Sleep with its less complex Command Deck. But with the gimmicky gameplays of the handheld games like Chain of Memories' card deck and DDD's command deck/weird mini-games, it's hard to play it.

"Pure has to be the most under rated racing game of the year. Think SSX but with ATV bikes and you'll know exactly how great this game is. Pure isn't bogged down by realism. You fly through the air and do some of the craziest tricks you'll ever seen in a racing game. The environments are gorgeous and lush. You'll travel all around the globe to race through a series of ten circuits with about 4 challenges each. You can create multiple bikes that specialize in speed, tricks, control and other items. The only down side is that their are a limited amount of challenges that sort of just repeat themselves throughout the game. Theirs the standard 3 lap race. A challenge mode where you have to get the highest score doing just tricks before you run out of gas. And lastly a  5 lap race with a much shorter track that relies more on technique than tricks and speed boosts. You'll have tons of fun unlocking new levels, characters, bike parts, and save slots for new bikes.

The only other con I can think of is the soundtrack choices and how the game doesn't allow you to use the new XMB function to play your own music while playing a game. Also a lack of trophies is a bummer. Everything else about this title is stellar and nobody expected the best racing game of the year to come from Disney.

"This. This is the game that you need to own if you enjoy anything horror. I hadn't even heard of this game until I was browsing new PS4 games and realized that this one didn't even sound familiar to me. Honestly, I'm glad that I didn't know about this because if I had, I would be itching to play it and waiting for the launch.

After reading many reviews about how awesome this game is, I pulled the trigger, drove to the store, bought it, and was instantly hooked. When I look for horror genre related books/movies/games, I am looking for something that will hold my attention and that is suspenseful, engaging, and realistic. This game is the perfect mix of all three of those. To top it all off, it is truly chilling.

Just reading the description, I was instantly engaged: ""When eight friends become trapped on a remote mountain getaway gone wrong, things quickly turn sinister and they start to suspect they aren't alone. Every choice the player makes while playing as each of the eight friends  even the seemingly trivial ones  will carve out a unique story. The player's actions alone determine who survives until dawn."" I mean, come on, that's just amazing.

Until Dawn is a game where player choice determines the outcomes in each chapter as well as the ending. With this being the case, you can literally play the game multiple times and have a different outcome each and every time. All I can say is give this game a shot. The graphics are beautiful, the sounds are even better.

The gameplay of Until Dawn focuses on quick time events, and discovering clues. A system is added to keep progress of all the secrets you find, which can help you piece things together. It's been noted to be similar to Heavy Rain. The player can take control of each of the eight characters, and can make simple choices which will effect the way the game plays out, resulting in deaths or other mayhem. There are over thousands of different endings possible in the game.

"It is a fairly large mouse yet my index and pinkie fingers tend to rest on my desk rather than the mouse holding them up. My hands are fairly large but not huge. I mainly wanted this mouse for the 6 thumb side buttons. Most gaming mice with these buttons have too many. I thought 6 would be just right for me. The positioning of the buttons and shape could be improved. They are thin and a little tricky to press. I personally have no real need for the dpi features or profiles. The mouse is very responsive and I have to get used to the idea that I no longer have to pick up and set the mouse down to move the pointer around. Infact with the shape of the mouse it is a bit difficult to pick it up one handed and it is a bit heavy; which I like. It is training me I don't need to do that anymore. Now I purchased mine used so the pads on the underside are worn pretty good. Because of this I suspect is the reason I find just moving the pointer short distances and being accurate is a bit tricky. I'll try some things to fix this issue that should only be an issue for me being I purchased mine used. Again, mine being used could be the reason I don't feel the right and left click have enough audible and tactile feedback. Overall I think the shape of the mouse could use a lot of improvement I like that it only has 6 side buttons and no more or less. I'm still getting used to it, but suspect I will enjoy it just fine. I also like that it is wireless; which works for me very well.",4.0,B00E4MQODC,Used - Review,Video Games

"The game is designed exceptionally well for an rpg the story line is engages you, the battles aren't super repeative some enemies have super powered moves you don't expect.  Plus you can only carry a limited amount of items.  The major down fall to this game is it's always been expensive 50 or 60 dollars when it first came out.  Now you can get it used for like 40 but people can beat the game in 4 hours if you really rush it and most can in under 10 hours.  Aside from that this is a rare that you will actually want to get into battles to look at the great graphics.  Plus the expected funny and challanging events make it fun as well.

"Sid Meier designed a game EVEN better than Civilization2.  It is hard to imagine that this could be done, but it has!!!
This game has everything:
Trade
Diplomacy
Scientific advances
War & Peace
Exploration
Culture
Money
Space Race
EVERYTHING
For those who are not familiar with Civ2, I will explain as simply as possible:  The whole idea of the game is to build the BEST CIVILIZATION possible.
What does this mean?  MANY THINGS.
YOU CAN WIN IN MANY WAYS:
1) Build a Civilization that achieves military dominance...CRUSH THOSE WHO OPPOSE!
2) Build a Civ that overwhelms all over Civs, so they want to be like you...IF YA CAN'T BEAT 'EM, GET THEM TO JOIN YOU!
3) Accumulate points that you are awarded for population, happiness of citizens, and even gaining knowledge.  BE THE BEST YOU CAN BE!
4) Expand.  Just be the BIGGEST Civ and you win by owning 66% of the world's land!  GO WEST/EAST/SOUTH/NORTH YOUNG MAN!!!
5) Be elected UN Secretary General by the players ...PLAY NICE WITH OTHERS!!!
6) Win the Space Race.  FIRST ONE OFF THE PLANET WINS!!!
Now, you may ask: Well, how do I do this?  GOOD QUESTION.
The answer is simple:
Build Cities
Have Wars/Declare Peace
Trade resources/luxuries
Gain Knowledge
All of this is done at the macro and micro level.  You can control cities' production of units, improvements, and wonders of the world.  This can also be given to a COMPUTER governor (AI).  This will speed up the game.  But if you love strategy and you love detail and control...YOU CAN DO IT ALL.  NONE of it remains out of your control...if you want.
This game is perfect because it allows you to control what you want, and nothing you don't.  The AI is good, the graphics excellent, the concept SUPERB, and the overall game STUNNING.
You will want to play this ENDLESSLY.  Strategy, action, tactics...it has it all!!!
However, should you buy this game and you listen to my recommendation...DO NOT BLAME ME FOR ALL THE TIME YOU LOSE IN YOUR LIFE...
YOU WILL LOVE THIS GAME!!!",5.0,B00005JC8D,YOU MUST BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!  (honestly),Video Games
"I'm writeing a pre-review. The game is to come out soon, and I just wanted to write this to get ahead of the game. I have been following the game for a while. This game should be really great when it comes out. The plot of the game is sort of like UO, and Everquest. Only that your in World War 2. You take missions and try to defeat the enemy. Its a totally 3D, totally 1st Person game. You take the spot land, sea or air. You can be a solider or tank crew or piolet or ship hand in an online 3D game. I won't even go into the details of how realistic the game is. One really cool feature is if you want to take out a tank, you don't just have to blow it up. You could shoot the driver through the slit in the driver seat, or throw a granade in the top, or blow the treds off or shoot the driver when he pops his head out the top, or any other way that a tank was taken out in World War 2. Also the war is planned out by real commanders, beople who pay the game and worked there way up in rank. Also the units are true to the time and historically acurate, so you will have to wait for 1942 in the game, to be a US solider and fly the B-17, but you could always be a tank commander while you wait. I highly recommend this game. *****",5.0,B00005K89C,Should be the best game EVER!!!,Video Games
"This game isn't bad at all, but you've got to be really, really patient to get to a point where you can enjoy it. There are 12 sequences in this game, without spoiling anything, you don't really start your official Assassin storyline until sequence 6. The first 5 sequences are all backstory and set up. While I found the first 2 sequences pretty entertaining (and a doozy of a plot twist at the end to get you pumped for the rest of the game), sequences 3-5 are SOOOOOOO boring and slow. It's basically one gigantic tutorial, and more backstory and set up. For someone who's played all previous Assassin's Creed games and knows how to free run, and fight, and so on, these tutorial sequences are punishing.

However, once you make it to sequence 6, you start your proper mission in the game and then all things are forgiven. The world is absolutely massive. There are optional objectives, minigames, hunting, sailing, and other shenanigans to take up. If you liked Assassin's Creed games before, you will love this game once you get to this point. It is worth mentioning though that enemies are in much greater number than before, and makes the game much more challenging than previous games. The minimap is also not as helpful. It doesn't point you to hiding spots, and doesn't point out wanted posters to lower your notoriety.

Naval missions should be a game unto themselves. Seriously, Ubisoft, make this a game unto itself. I will buy it. Trust me, you have never played anything quite like this in a video game before.

Overall, I was glad that I only paid $35 to buy this game. The 6 sequences make it hard to recommend this game. Sequences 1 and 2 are interesting and have a great storyline by themselves with a heck of a twist, but 3-5 are just terrible. From that point on its standard Assassin's Creed fare. The world is immersive, the storyline is fantastic, and the gameplay has a lot of freedom. Just be very, very patient with it.",4.0,B000P46NMA,Takes a LOOOOOONG time to get anywhere,Video Games
"In years 1-4, I always thought it was so tedious to have to keep switching to Wingardium Leviosa to put objects together and then go back to Reducto to smash things, but in years 5-7, that's like an automatic feature! You don't have to have keep switching spells. No matter what spell you're using, objects that can be put together automatically turn purple and you can swish them up.

Also, when using the red spells that you buy at the Weasley's joke shop, you can select just one to use instead of all of them constantly switching around on you.

Game play was very cool and the ghost that you have to follow flows a lot faster than in 1-4. The cut scenes were, of course, very cute and funny. Overall, I was very satisfied with this game.

"Enemy Territory: Quake wars doesn't break any new ground. After playing similar titles I found this one to be medicore at best for some. There may be some out their who like the alien i.e. Strogg part of the game which is one of the few things that I liked. I guess I will list what I consider to be the goodies in the game. First all maps are available, You can play either side, you can practice with the bots. Strogg has Mech. That's about all I liked, What I didn't like, The sound is pitifull, your weapons sound like the very first games on a nitendo or a pc with a primitive sound card. Some of the vehicles you can't drive and shoot at same time. No 1st person view in the vehicles except for some turret views. A lot of these type of games can get repitive but are still fun, I was bored in about 2 hours and wished I had held out for Battlefield Bad Company and just rented ETQW. The graphics are medicore, To me the game looked like it was produced just to make money. Just from looking at the amount of reviews so far, two, it doesn't look like a lot of people have gotten too excited by it. Also some games the controller layout is pretty intuitive, this is not one of those games. No melee, you get a knife but by the time you switch to it or grenade, well it's too long to cycle through. Also like all Quake games it's speeded up which is ok unless you like a more realistic game like Call of Duty 4. This one always sound like a herd of mice fleeing a cat.

"Long loading times at the start of every battle.  A battle system that forces you to fight a certain way; a certain way that makes even the trivial random encounters take >5 minutes per battle.

"When I saw the previews for this game last year, I was thinking yeah, yeah, Far Cry: Primal with mechs *yawn*. OMG was I so WRONG! This game has an incredible story with some of the best combat around. The action combat of shoot & roll is phenomenal! Players will really feel in the thick of it, and hoping that they draw no more that 2 machines at a time.

The animations are spot on. The way toddler Aloy runs - so adorable! The side quests were well thought out and never felt repetitive. Aloy's main quest to find her origins drug me in. Not in quite some times have I been so anxious to find out the answers and so apprehensive to finish the game. Oh the dichotomy of wanting to finish the game, but at the same time wanting MORE! Guerrilla Games did a superb job of making the open world feel dangerous, and not some walk in the park. But not ""Dark Souls"" difficult. Thank you so much. I bought the collectors edition for the statue and was not disappointed.

If you get the game, make sure to put the HUD in dynamic display to reduce the clutter on the screen.

Pros
* Story, story, story!
* Well executed action combat
* Balanced combat
* Machine animations
* Beautiful Graphics

* Aloy is missing a facial scar (or at least I never saw it)

"Silent Hill: Homecoming is a noteworthy addition to the series for 2 reasons: one, it is not made by long-time makers Team Silent in Japan but rather American company Double Helix. Two, it adds new things never seen in the series such as a new camera style and combat mechanics. Fans were understandably skeptical and thought ""god I hope it doesn't suck"". While it's not flawless, I have to say I really enjoyed the game and as a fan of the series I don't consider this a blemish or an absolute triumph the way Resident Evil 4's overhaul was. It's entertaining and creepy and that's really all I was looking for when I played.

Story: You play as Alex Sheperd, a young soldier returning from the war when news that his younger brother, Josh, is missing. Coming into the town of Sheperd's Glen, Alex finds the town strangely deserted save for a few residents who act less than normal, a thick layer of fog and strange creatures around.  Alex has to uncover the truth of what's happening to his hometown as well as find his brother and almost literally has to go to hell and back to do so. The one issue people might have with the plot is that it's probably the most straightforward of the series. In a series known for being slightly ambiguous, there's really nothing here you have to ponder over or ask people online what it was you just saw.  While the actual story is interesting, some might not like that it's a bit easier to ""get"" a Silent Hill game.

Graphics: Originally the game previously had static camera angles which made it frustrating when escaping from a creature had you running back to them thanks to the angle switch. Now the camera is more free-roam in a 3D environment and it is way easier to navigate the levels.  Plus the levels are actually quite detailed and from the peeling paint and missing floors to the grimy and industrial look of the transformed versions of levels look quite foreboding and grimy. Only issue is that character faces look kind of...strange and your flashlight frequently goes from uber-bright to near useless. But the fog outside and the grain filter on several cutscenes is quite good.

Sound/Music: For those who have worries about the soundtrack well no fear, Akira Yamaoka is here with his trademark rock pieces as well as vocals by Mary Elizabeth McGlynn just like always. It's what makes the game quite special since everything about it in the sound mix from the ambience to win a drum piece would start up and the delicate and haunting piano themes help to punctuate certain moments. As for voice acting, everyone particularly Alex is well done that is except for one character: the reason you're playing through the game in the first place, Josh. He barely emotes and he's so flat and disinterested sounding that you can't believe you gotta save the little snot.

Gameplay: Since the camera's changed, the environments are a lot more spaced out, fully 3D so you have to push stuff out of the way, duck under openings, and climb over ledges and whatnot. In addition, the same items return from first aid kits to health packs and weaponry. Your inventory (health drinks, puzzle items) are on the LB whereas combat (knife, pipe, guns as well as option to turn off flashlight and the radio) is on the RB. It's a lot easier system to use than having to cycle through menus though occasionally I'll use a health drink when I didn't mean to. But I quite like the control scheme and camera and I kind of dread returning to the old style now. Only thing I wish was different is the puzzles since unlike Resident Evil's old love of doors that need emblems rather than just, you know, a normal key, Silent Hill's puzzles range from little logic puzzles to the always-popular sliding block kind. They're a bit too flow-breaking and never really sat well with me on this one.

Overhauled is the combat system and it's one of those ""works but other times doesn't"" additions. Whereas Resident Evil 4's gameplay change helped it for the better, it helps it here but doesn't perfect it. Basically holding LT puts you in combat stance or aim mode and A is your weak attack while X is your strong attack which can be held for an even stronger attack (your log chopping swing for the axe, or baseball swing for pipe for example) and your B will act is the mandatory dodge button. While enemies were easily avoided in previous games, because of the level layout such as cramped rooms, it's hard to escape enemies so you have to fight but some have really cheap attacks such as Siam while the Smog can best be killed using handgun ammo and it's always best not to waste those. It's much better than before but it's still got a few kinks.

In a strange bit of irony, Silent Hill 4: The Room and even 3 was criticized for being too stagnant, too familiar to past entries whereas Homecoming with its changes for the better has people lamenting the old style. I think they just don't like Americans doing it, personally and speaking as a fan I quite like this one but not necessarily loved. For me, nothing beats Silent Hill 2 but as a new entry in the series, Homecoming works quite well.",5.0,B00149MEWI,A surprising and welcome addition,Video Games

"This is the EPITOME of graphic adventures. No other game has even come close to GRIM FANTANGO when it comes to humor (of all shades and shapes), inventiveness, delicious irony, creative graphics and plain good-ol' FUN!!

This is a 15-year old game mind you - yet, it retains its freshness as any true work of art. THIS is the road not taken by the gaming industry. THIS is how computer games should have been. Not the pathetic cookie-cutter products of mega-corporations working in-tandem with hardware companies and trying to hook everybody with their latest Always-Online DRM scheme...

Your character (hilarious and lovable Manny Calavera) is already...dead when you start. In fact he has been dead for some time, stuck in limbo, trying to pay his way to a better afterlife by selling tickets to other souls on their way to paradise. Guess what: corruption is not limited just to this world. And where there is corruption, there is oppression; and where there is oppression, there is always a revolution brewing...

Realizing he is being duped, Manny reluctantly joins the afterlife underground and takes us in a tour de force of one of the MOST BEAUTIFUL GAME EVER PRODUCED. Immersing noirish atmosphere, detailed art-deco settings, fast Bogartian dialogs - with a subtle ironic frosting.

"For awhile I was on nothing but destiny. I still love it. However I swayed away because I needed the change, and variety is important. I started with Dying light, side note here is that if you like a zombie game go get dying light right now. I loved the sh** out of that game. Could've been a bit longer.. I personally got rid of it after completion because I won't wait for or purchase ""add on"" garbage. because that's all it is.

Back to this game.
Graphically 4/5 I think theres some parts they could've improved but overall it's rather good. the system runs a little rough here and there, but It hasn't effected or bothered my game play yet. The classes are fun to be part of although I immediately changed my classes after getting through the first part with one class. If you've played DA in the past this is essentially a must have to feel complete.
The story is huge and i'm constantly picking up a new quest here and there while trying to complete another one for some fool who can't carry a sword to protect themselves.
I haven't even came to killing a dragon yet (although one killed me because I walked up on its roost and spooked it) and I'm already immersed in and loving this game. The more you get into this game the stronger it will hold you. There's endless areas to explore, things to collect, and evil doers to slay.

The menu system I think could've used a little bit of work as well, although i have grown more used to it. I get a bit mixed up gearing up all 4 of my characters at once trying to remember which one wears what can be stressful. however once you get past the rush style life we're used to and pay attention to what you have, one can carefully plan a magic defense, distance, or CQC defense depending on what area you're coming up on to attack.

I did do this game as a download through xbox live i'm not sure if the disk is any different but something I do love is that I turn on my xbox, watch some netflix or something and when I go back to the game it's loaded where I left, no boot up or anything, simply constantly ready. It's rather nice. It's made doing whatever I want or need to do easy and seamless to switch back to my game.

I've yet to get through the first map that i scouted a town at initially... i foresee many travels in my future.

"It was absolutely intriguing. This was a game I was very happy to play through. This setting was superb, and the gameplay was agreeable.

However, I will speak on something I was not fond of. There is a character, Triss, that loves the character you play as, Geralt. I even read Triss's character page and it read, ""She loves Geralt and wants more than anything for him to choose her"" or something. So I got to know Triss, and I liked her. The voice actress portraying her was a good choice, she has a very sweet voice, and her character design is different than most women, as she has a unique hairstyle. Also, they give her good dialogue and she feels like a real person, as is the case with many characters in this game. So, anyway, there are whores in the game that you can have sex with, but I never had sex with any of them or did anything with any women in the game. I was hoping that there would be a dialogue option to tell Triss, ""I choose you,"" but, there wasn't. Nothing happens. At all. So for me I felt like there was no payoff for being faithful to Triss...

Anyway, a lot of the quests in this game are pretty interesting. I really have no complaints when it comes to the setting and story and what not. Except that I would have liked more options at some parts to choose what happens. So storywise and setting was pretty solid.

Combat was pretty lame in some parts of the game. After you get the hang of it, it is decent, but nothing special. It just doesn't feel satisfying enough, and it sucks when you leave a village and immediately a giant scorpion will just kill you in a few hits. And enemies always try to outnumber you and then you have to try and roll around and separate them a bit so you even have a chance to get some offense in. So the combat is acceptable, but by no means is it good.

The map was not the most cooperative, and sometimes I was not sure where to go or how to get to the next section. Also there were several quests that I did not know how to finish and ended up skipping them unfortunately.

A downside is how the game is fairly linear and has a beginning, a middle, and then an end, and that is it. There are no other game modes than Story, and after completing the story I haven't touched this game since. Well, I tried to play through it again, but after 10 minutes I stopped. Most games I do not like replaying the Story. After hearing the same dialogue a second time, it loses the appeal. And in a game where you level up, going back to level 1 and getting killed easily is just not fun and leveling up again is not at all fun.

So I give this game a 4/5 for the reasons above. But this is a review of the game itself, if I was comparing it to other RPGs, this is better.

"This game works well, not perfectly but does seem to work ok.  I think many people are upset they can't ""beat"" the game in 30 hours or something and that its not the same as Skyrim.  These MMO games aren't like that.  In the game there's only certain places where other players can kill you.  Otherwise your on your own or you will have to team up to get thru some dungeons and some quests.",4.0,B0081Q58AW,This game is actually pretty nice,Video Games

"I don't know if I've ever seen any game come down in price this much this quickly. Maybe it's because no one wants to keep it for very long!

At first, I thought this game was great. After playing it almost every day for about 5 weeks, I have a very different view.

Pros-

Most of the games are actually fun at first. You'll probably learn some words and their spelling. Easy to pick up.

Now for the much longer list of cons-

This game does a terrible job of gauging your current level. It asks you far too few words, almost all of which are highly advanced, and placed both my friend and I FAR lower than it should have. There's nothing you can do about that. I'm 24 years old, and after 5 weeks of updating my expression potential to 34%, I'm still seeing words like kettle, jaguar, squirt, traumatic, solitary, airfield, canine, rephrase, acoustic, receptive, sparrow, nutrition, slang, stumbling, optimism, and so forth. I would say 80% of the words I've seen on here are elementary school level, while the other 20% are middle-school level. I have not ""learned"" a single word that I would consider calling high-school level.

You'll learn very little for the time you spend playing. Of the few words that were new to me, hardly any of them were repeated more than a few times, often in the same day. You are bombarded with far too many words over time, when it should just be reinforcing groups of words before moving on to more. Also, the only time you actually learn anything is when you read through the definitions after each game. There's nothing at all to be learned by playing the games. It teaches you like a dictionary does. But the worst part is that there is no context or pronunciation! After playing for long enough, you will eventually unlock a game that doesn't count toward your EP, but does have recordings of the words being spoken as well as context examples. However, you can only access these one random word at a time. You are given very little time to read the examples. This means that pronunciation and context are on the game, but you can't look them up or access them at all while supposedly updating your potential to express yourself with words you don't necessarily understand.

The definitions are often VERY weak. The part of speech (verb, noun...) is not given at all. If a definition is too long then it simply cuts off rather than allowing you to scroll down to read the whole thing. Many words appear in their own definition, which is never acceptable. Words with multiple definitions will only have one of them provided. Some definitions couldn't possibly be more wrong: inflammable is defined as, ""Things that burn very easily."" First of all, inflammable is an adjective and the definition is given for a plural noun. Also, while it is technically true, it has been a VERY long time since vernacular changed to avoid confusion, and even my dictionary suggests that you not use the word like this.

The simple little games become mundane very quickly. You would have to play this game for several months to really get that much out of it, but it will get very boring long before that. Most of what your coach says to you is hardly better than mindless dribble. The graphics are quite simple and the music is extremely limited and dull. One day it randomly told me that the word of the week is minstrel. Apparently the word of the week means a word you won't be learning, because it never gave me the definition or even put it in any of the games.  It's not that uncommon for it to tell me that my EP has been updated when in fact it is exactly the same.

Ultimately, the developers were too lazy to provide the necessary elements for learning a new word, make it accurately gauge your personal level, come up with enough games to keep it interesting for a long time; they didn't even make sure they got the definitions right! They started with a great idea, and released a product that falls unforgivably short of its potential.",2.0,B000ME25P2,Not for people who are serious about actually learning the words,Video Games

"I want to make it clear this is a review of the Demo only.

I'm a long time role playing games fan and player. I was excited about Risen because the same group made Gothic 1 and 2 which were great games. But I was very disappointed after playing the demo. Many problems with the game. First, combat is boring and clunky. This is one of the most important areas in a rpg to get right since you will be doing combat for a vast amount of time in the game, in Risen the combat feels really clunky and hard to control and is boring on top of it. I can't imagine playing through the whole game with this kind of combat engine and mechanics.

Second, the world feels compact and small. You barely move over a hill or some ground and you are already in the next important area of the game. For some reason they put everything close together on the island. Third, the world has blurry graphics and terrible lighting. All the textures are hard to make out and they have some kind of blurriness to them, the lighting is very dark and should have been much brighter. Everything looks washed out, murky and blurry. It's not an attractive world to walk around in or explore to say the least.

Lastly, this game is basically an inferior remake of the Gothic 1 and Gothic 2 games. Most everything is recycled from those games, including the sound effects and monsters. Except the voice acting is bad and uninspired, where in the previous Gothics they had good voice work that was memorable. Also the combat in those Gothics was way better and more exciting. Even the graphics were better in that they were more pleasing to look at and create a superior atmosphere, even though they are outdated by several years, than in this game which had a poor artistic vision.

My advice is to try the demo before you buy the game. And then go ahead and buy Gothic 1 or Gothic 2 instead and play that if you haven't already, they are much better games than this inferior remake.",2.0,B002C0VNQQ,Try before you buy,Video Games
"While the latest PS3 and Xbox 360 versions of Midnight Club have gotten the most attention, this LA Remix version will please PSP fans looking for some hot, wild racing on the go.

This version in fact adds a second city, Tokyo, which you unlock in career mode after mastering LA.

LA Remix also has ad-hoc wireless racing for up to four players.

In short, at $40, this version of MC probably gives you the most bang for your buck.

And did I mention how good the game looks on the PSP's bright little screen?  Beautiful -- and the cars handle wonderfully as well.

What cars are here?  Tuners including a Pontiac Solstice and Chevy Cobalt SS Supercharged.  Muscle cars past and present, like a '69 Mustang Boss 302, a '70 General Lee, and the new Camaro.  Plus exotics like the Aston Martin V8 Vantage Roadster, the Ford GT and Shelby Cobra, a brace of Lambos, and a Saleen S7.  No Ferraris or Bugattis, unfortunately...

There are shortcuts and multiple routes... cop chases and interference... wild power-ups and air time... and your car takes damage -- too much, and the race is over!

The long and short is -- there's tons of fun for PSP fans here.  Highly recommended!",5.0,B0019C6KAC,Current Best Racer on PSP,Video Games

"This game is alot of fun. I have had it since it came out and I'm writing my first review for it now 3 years later in 2010.

Its an online only game and you can grab it at such a bargain for a mere $20. Warhawk has a following only compared to SOCOM. Plenty of people play online still and theres no problem finding a game 3 years from its release. The graphics aren't Uncharted 2 amazing but they look great.

The game play is awesome. Alot of variety. You can drive tanks, jeeps, and airplanes(Warhawks). Its fun grabbing some body on the battle field in your jeep and then plowing through the opponents base,mowing down enemies while you drive and your friend shooting the turret. Did I forget to mention JET PACKS?? Yes this game has jet packs. You can grab a jet pack, fly around maps while sniping, rocket launching, grenade throwing, machine gunning, or flame throwing enemies!!!

Now, this game is an online game so of course theres ranks to move up. All the guns are pick ups in the game, so theres no unlocking guns or different vehicles. You rise through the ranks by meeting requirements. Each rank has a certain amount of points you need to acquire and a specific medal to achieve. You earn points by defeating enemies, capturing flags, capturing bases, repairing vehicles, or what ever your objective is. You earn medals by accomplishing a specific achievement. For instance destroying 5 Warhawks while in a tank, or Capturing the flag 3 times in one Capture The Flag match. Theres about 20 ranks. You unlock new gear to customize your character and new paint jobs to customize your Warhawk when ranking up as well.

Theres plenty of game modes, and the max number of players on a map is 24. I do have some complaints. One major one is Friend inviting or grouping. You cant send game invites, or meet up with your friends in a group then go right into a game and be all together. The only way to do this is one person has to create a room, then your friends have to go to there buddy list and find your name, click on it, then join your game. Its a pain, especially when you have about 5 friends that want to play with you. Plus, if your friends follow you into a game some one else made it balances out the teams. So, if all your friends wound up on the other team you won't be able to switch teams unless the there team is down a man. ANOTHER, issue is the balancing of vehicles. You can blow up a Warhawk with one tank missile, yet you can fire a barrage of missiles at a tank and it won't explode. The game is titled Warhawk yet the weakest vehicle in the game is the Warhawk.

All, in all this game is extreme fun. I refuse to trade this game in 3 years down the line because I keep coming back to it for days at a time. A MUST OWN for a PS3 owner.",3.0,B000WJFZEA,SO MUCH FUN!!! HUGE FOLLOWING!!,Video Games

"I didn't know what to expect from this headset. There's never a balance between great sound quality and durability, many just feel cheap. First, the Plantronics feel great. The plastic feels sturdy. Also, the headphones are extremely comfortable. I wore them for over three hours and didn't realize I had them on until I got up and nearly dragged my PS4 and iPod across the floor!

The set up was a bit tricky. The instructions are easy to follow but -- there are some wires to deal with, coupling that with the many that are already all over my floor ... it's not pretty. It is a sacrifice. But to have custom soundtracks while playing all the launch games I purchased, and knowing that I had the ability to chat comfortably, and not worry about that horrible ear bud that came standard with the PS4 made it worth it!

What I do/don't like about the Rig? I honestly can't think of a negative. I swapped out my iPod and tried it with my Cowon X7 and it still worked. I tried it also with my PS3 and my 360, and got the same results. It also comes with two mics so you can use the RIg on the go. I wanted to see how these held up with my Klipsch. I use Klipsch on the go because the sound on them is EXCELLENT and if they were to be lost I wouldn't have to break the bank to replace them (they're reasonably priced). The Rig sounds just as great.

"El Shaddai is a pretty game and I applaud the developers for taking such huge visual risks, but at the end of the day it's just a polished lump of poo. I can forgive an incomprehensible story, but I can't forgive terrible platforming mechanics and a boring combat system especially if those two pieces of broken gameplay make up 80% of the game.

First the jumping/platforming mechanics. You will be really annoyed. The collision detection is spotty at best so you will fall to your death quite a lot and will curse the game for not thinking through the fixed camera's poor choice of viewing angles.

The combat system is a based on three weapons and every type of enemy has a weakness to each. This rock-paper-scissor system would be fun if it weren't so poorly executed. You have essentially one main attack per weapon and you'll spend the entire game mashing on the one button to fight the same three re-skinned enemies. Fortunately there are boss fights that break things up otherwise it would have been seven hours of monotony. Aside from that, the attacks are far from accurate and you never feel like you're wielding a giant magical blade or massive gauntlets, it feels like swinging around a wimpy wad of wet newspaper producing equally wimpy sounds.

"Amazing console, I was so happy when I first opened it! The graphics are a step or few from previous gen. It's so quite when you play a game and makes little to no noise when you are on YouTube or other media services. It's so majestic with its led lighting and parallelogram shape. The controller IS a step up from the PS2/3 one but I'm still getting used to it. The only bad thing that I encountered was how long it took me to download games that I had from PS3 that included free upgrade to PS4 like COD AW. I was also sent a voucher code for my choice of 1 of 4 games for free, naturally I picked Far Cry 4 and ignored the others, it wasn't until 11:30pm till I was able to play a game I wanted because of the download time but I tested my connection and it was at 12-14 Mbps compared to the normal 35-40 Mbps that I'm used to so Internet was slow that day. So it's just me. But I will probably buy physical games for now(maybe) just to avoid the download time. Biggest game I have is COD AW at 45 GB compared to biggest game on my PS3 which is at 22 GB(same size for Destiny PS4) so 500 GB is probably not as big as first expected, for PS3 yes but for ps4 tyou will eventually run out of space. Luckly Sony lets you UPGRADE the hard drive unlike a certain company. So I might upgrade to a 2 TB later in the year just so I won't have to worry about space anymore. I will also install intercoolers because it maintains the motherboard cool therefore making your console last forever.....until the intercooler gives up of course.

My only complaint so far is that the player I was playing co-op with last night didn't have a mic/headset.

"fun game and the  most important thing is that my FX 8320 cpu and my evga gtx 760 runs it with max settings and at 60 fps all the time ( single mission I don't play multiplayer )

what I don't like is that some times the enemies are too small or their uniforms are the same color as the background and you cant see them, the other day I was shooting at a tree because it look like a bad guy to me.

graphics: I thought that this game will be a next gen  game but the graphics are just a little bit better than call of duty modern warfare 3 about 15% so I don't understand why does the game take so much space to install? I also own battlefield 4 and those graphics are beautiful but on call of duty ghost the graphics are a disappointment for a pc

weapons: the weapon selection is very nice and they look very good but the sound of the gun shoots makes you thing that you are shooting a toy, I understand that this is a game but when I compared to the sound of the guns in battlefield 3 or 4 or medal of honor warfighter which by the way looks graphically  better that ghost you realize that they developers did not care about the sounds of the bullets fired by the weapons.

after all I did like that game and will play it again but this game should have been released about 3 or 4 years ago when there was only ps3 and xbox 360 so the graphics could not be better than that but for a new gen console or a PC the graphics in the game are a shame",3.0,B00CLW3TZS,good game horrible graphics for a new gen game,Video Games

"This headset represents fantastic bang-for-the-buck. They're not ""oh my god!"" amazing, but they are far better than I expected for the ~$45 price tag. I anticipated burning through them fairly quickly (out of dissatisfaction or low build quality) and moving up, but I always like to give entry-options a whirl. These are a surprisingly great piece of hardware!

Pros include really decent sound (both headphone and mic), nice inline controls, really well designed microphone (I love how it bends and easily swivels out of your way if not using), comfortable padding around the ears, a nice braided cable, nice swivel ear cup design, and other features that I would anticipate on a higher quality set only. However, it's not without some drawbacks. The biggest drawback is that, despite the fairly ample padding on the headband, these things hurt the top of my head. I've gotten used to it, and they no longer bother me, but for a long time, I could only use them for 20 minutes at a time or so, before my head was really sore. Wearing a hat helped some, but ironically, now seems to make it worse. The only other problem I've had with these is that the sound from the headphones sometimes bleeds over into the mic. When I'm playing a game and I'm talking, people can often hear my in-game sounds, whereas they should only be hearing my voice. I don't think it's a volume thing with sound escaping the headphones. I get the impression that the audio is bleeding over somehow, be it a hardware or software problem. Then again, I could be wrong about the origin of the problem.

That said, it's a small drawback in an otherwise really great headset. I'm not sure that paying two or three times as much as any chance of netting you a two or three time gain in quality. The fact is, these things are surprisingly high-quality, and I'm impressed. From someone who has gone through a fair number of headsets, and who wasn't expecting much, I'm pleased to say I'd buy these again in a heartbeat.",4.0,B00BFOEY4I,Excellent headset with high-end features; best bang for buck!,Video Games

"With all the various puzzle games available for the DS, there isn't really all that much anymore that can make one stick out more than another.  Puzzle Quest manages to stand on it's own thanks to it being an incredibly addictive mash of puzzle and RPG elements that set it apart from the rest of the pack.  Starting out as a typical RPG, you perform combat by partaking in puzzles that are reminiscent of Bejeweled.  You take turns moving pieces around and the game even requires some strategy to it as well.  The fact that the puzzle and RPG elements are combined here, and that they actually work as well, is reason enough to pick up Puzzle Quest alone.  The game's overall presentation is fresh and the main quest is incredibly long and also features some incredibly addictive puzzle gameplay that will keep you playing Puzzle Quest for quite some time.  The only downsides to Puzzle Quest are that the puzzle field is cramped on the bottom screen of the DS, and it's easy to miss something in the heat of gameplay.  Not to mention that many of the enemies throughout the game can be very frustrating, but the good definitely outweighs the bad here thanks to the addictive gameplay.

"The problems with this game are the reasons I ""got off of"" superhero games a couple of years ago.
So, first the bad:
-  Similar to other past superhero games, each level/checkpoint looks exactly like the one you just left...with some minor changes.
-  Also, the enemies came at me in waves so familiar I could feel a spider web shooter slowly forming on my ring-hand wrist.
-  I always seem to be destracted by how the camera angle is not adjusted during play with the right stick.  The default angle serves you pretty well undr most conditions but I kept hitting the right stick late into the game expecting to move the camera.
-  I can't wait until technology finally catches up with the potential for superhero games.  I'm burnt out on the small character in the middle of the screen with limited powers and no ability to fly at will.

The Good:
-  The did a good job with the ring weapons.  There are enough I didn't get tired of them through the whole game.  And, you can't over-use any single one since your enemies will demand certain attacks.
-  The two player set-up is good, you're able to join in at any time.  I do not beleive the 2nd player can earn achievments.  But, that second person comes in handy for sure, especially if you don't play on the easiest level.

Lastly,
Come on video game makers! We need a new mindset or something when it comes to these classic superhero's being brought to life in games.  I'm guessing the desire to release these games in conjunction with the movie release is causing some re-hashing of old tricks with a slightly new look.  I can no longer fool myself into believing that this all-powerful, classic superhero's powers are limited to a 10' circle around him, and I can no longer believe that his power of flight is now reduced to a series of dashes and jukes.",3.0,B004BD1DWG,"Another superhero game, same complaints.",Video Games

"Yes, it is short.  I played for 30 hours and I used a bit of that time to exploit a bug where I could raid the cash of a vending machine over and over.

Graphics and story are great.  Game is very linear and entails a lot of story telling.  Mechanics are well introduced over time making it not too overwhelming at any given time.  Interesting use of 'steam punk' type technology and references to Quantum Mechanics (which was just being explored in the early 1900's).  Yes, there are religious and racial overtones which I think are applicable for the timeframe and put the appropriate negative spot light on them as deserved, as are important events in US history.  I used a controller while playing the game and I can't imagine using anything different, but others say keyboard/mouse is the way to go, so perhaps we can just say the game works superbly either way.

"First off the collector's package isn't anything special. As one reviewer mentioned not even a included manual! Instead they give you a simple mftr slip with the control scheme and Steam activation process. Read steam part thoroughly before anything else of course. Now the game is awesome. I reinstalled Windows XP and everything else just to be on the safe side being I was getting errors previously. Put in the DVD-ROM and I was off to installing HL2. Steam didn't take long and I was gaming within forty minutes. Steam installed the other included games as well. I've never played any previous HL variants and I must admit I'm itching to try HL Source1.

Great thing about DVD-ROM is none of the annoyance with swapping installing CD-ROMs otherwise DVD-ROM is not needed to game. Definitely want to clear out HDD space or defrag at least prior to installation. Game runs great and very DOOM 3 like scares/chills around every corner. The biggest nuisance for me are the getting STUCK BEHIND OBJECTS (Stairs, steps, ladders, flat objects/debrew inches off the ground!) often in the most critical moments. Thats a big bug it definitely ruins the moments that should be flawless.

Game progress is very good pace. Playing with all in game video settings set to *High, but the game still doesn't look as sharp as Far Cry or Doom 3 on my PC. Of course my PC is nothing special either. System specs: Gigabyte NForce2 GA-7N400 PRO2, Athlon XP 2600+ 2.079 GHz, 512MBx2 Geil Value PC3200 Dual Channel, ATi AIW 9600 XT, and Thermaltake 480W PSU. I'm happy with the video display I get, but definitely know I'm not getting the full experience. I guess HL2 auto-detect won't allow for Very-High settings if system can't run smoothly, because my game play is quite smooth even at HIGH settings with 2X AA. Definitely give this game a go, but make sure you have Internet connection first. Also I trully recommend at least a videocard upgrade to an ATi Radeon 9600 PRO 128MB (around $100 at NewEgg.com) or anything equivelent or better that fully supports DirectX 9.0b features. Being STEAM is a long-term uncertainty and unsure about reinstall process definitely make the first run the best. Do yourself a favor and buy this game. If the same price buy this DVD-ROM Collector's Eddition instead of CD-ROM variants. Otherwise turn the speakers high and become Gordon Freeman.",5.0,B0002X7Y2C,Excellent Game.,Video Games

"This compilation comes with Far Cry 2, Far Cry 3 and Far Cry Blood Dragon and my particular disk has all three games on it that you have to install to the PS3.  None of the games had download codes, so at least it appears with latest compilations being sold (of course that may depend on the seller), they are all on disk.  With that being said though, each game does take a bit of time to install from the disk, especially FC3.  I always tend to be a bit behind on games I want to play, mainly because I usually wait for the prices to go down from the usual starting price and the lack of time I have to play.  Because of that I sometimes miss some of the ones I want to play and the Far Cry series is one of those, but when I saw this compilation recently go on sale during the holidays for 12 dollars for the 3 games on PS3, I bought it.  I figured that if I didn't like it so much, it wasn't a big investment per game, plus it gives me a chance to decide if I like the series enough to get the new Far Cry games later on that are out on PS4.

Granted these games have been reviewed individually since they have been out a while, but since I am new to them, I will give my initial impressions to each.

FC2 is probably my least favorite of the three games due to some of the limitations in gameplay but considering this game is around 7 years old, it still has some things going for it that makes it fun to play.  The graphics are decent considering the games age, although it would have been nice if they had released a remastered version with updated graphics.  The sounds in the world are realistic from the wild animals in the jungle, to the crunch of the brush and even to the crusty old jeep you drive.  The story line is decent and interesting enough to make me feel involved in the outcome.  I am only about 20 percent in but there seems to be a lot of missions and things to do, although I will say some of the missions are a bit repetitive and at every guard post it seems you get attacked.  Sometimes it is hard to see enemies as well when they seem to be able to hit you much easier than you can them.  The whole malaria thing to me is a bit annoying but it does add a different element to the game.  I also think the driving with the GPS and using the map while walking is not as intuitive as I would like and a bit distracting, but it could also be because I have been use to different styles of gameplay from other games and it is taking me time to adjust.  There are a few issues I have found as well such as a guy shooting a different direction and I still get hit.  There is some variety in the weapons and upgrades but limitations with carrying them and ammo.  I am also not crazy about the save in certain spots limitation the game has on the PS3 as well.  As a game on its own, I am not sure I would have made a solo purchase but as part of this 3 game package, this is a decent enough to make me feel like I got my moneys worth.

As it is expected with sequels (especially one that has nearly 4 years since the previous FC2), FC3 is sleeker and sharper with its graphics with a large environment that has many more things to do than FC2.  In addition to the missions, there are the added elements of hunting and making things in the game.  Although I am not quite as far into FC3 as I would like to be, mainly because I want to finish up FC2 before I move onto to the next, I have so far enjoyed this game enough to make this purchase worth it for this game on its own.  The graphics and sounds within the game are good and much improved over the previous FC.  The story for me is interesting enough to get me involved right away with the game opening with you stuck in a cage trying to make a dramatic get away.  The missions seem at least to me from the onset seemed to be more focused and directed but not so much that it detracts from the open feel.  There is a really nice balance of stealth and combat here that gives some variety in how to approach a mission.  There are a few minor issues that I have come across but they are not enough to make me stop playing.

Blood dragon is something a little different than what I have come to expect in the series but with being different with its tongue and cheek sci-fi approach.  Since I am working on finishing the first two games, I have played this the least but the game play seems to be pretty similar to FC3.  Considering this was DLC originally this is pretty good game overall, but as with most DLC it is not as deep with as much gameplay as the FC3 main game.  As part of the 3 game package though, this makes a nice diversion to play once I finish the first two games.

Overall, for a 3 game compilation at less than 20 bucks, then this is worth it, especially if you are like me and missed playing all of the games in the series when they first came out.

"If you are a Bond fan that enjoyed Everything or Nothing needs to buy this game as well. The justice that was done to Pierce in EON, the same is done in this one, with improvements on things that were seen in the original game. The newest feature that is on this game is the ""Bond focus"" that allows you to zoom in on enemies and shoot bombs and radios on the enemy soldier's waist. The story is told, and stays true enough to the movie that all fans will want to play this. The gameplay is very much the same as EON, so that is why this game would probably appeal more to fans of that game. The sweetest part is that Sean Connery himself actually talks for Bond in the game. I used to think that they must have just took his voice from the movie, but Connery actually sat in the studio and did the voice! I couldn't believe it, and it sounds great as Connery gets to be Bond once again in his favorite 007 movie.

"I like this controller, it works for basic games, but the joysticks aren't the best. They do have some deadspots,and just don't respond well. Also my up button on the D pad randomly shorts out every once in a while. I had my camera view bound to that button and my view would randomly change from time-to-time. I deactivated that button and moved the camera view to another button and it never happened again. It seems to short out or something while playing.

Some of the buttons aren't reconized by games. I play Dirt 3 and the D pad and buttons would not work on the game menus. I had to use the keyboard to change options or settings or join or leave races. I thought it was the game that was designed bad. But today I got an XBOX 360 controller and hooked that up. The D buttons and other buttons now activate the game menus so I no longer need the keyboard at all. Also, the game now provides me with extra options that I've never even seen before, like changing the person who I am spectating during the race or changing over view settings that I never new existed so I now get more functions with the game. Those functions never even showed up in the game until I plugged in the new controller. The icons were always there, but they were grayed out.

I don't know why this controller wouldn't operate the same menus. And there is no way in the games options to bind the keys to any menus.

I do like the controller and I'm going to keep it incase my XBOX 360 controller breaks, but I probably won't use it anymore.

Also, the B button seems to short out as well. I had my horn bound to the B button and it would randomly work and if I held the button down after a few seconds the horn would stop. I thought that was the game as well, but that doesn't happen on my new controller.

It's a nice controller, and feels good in my hand. But for a few dollars more, you can get one that is much more responsive and provides more support for game functions. I give it a 3 because it looks cool, and I like the design of it. Having the joysticks both at the bottom, is really nice. It makes the controller more comfterable than the XBOX 360 controller which stretches my hand too much.",3.0,B003VAHYQY,It works for basic games.,Video Games

"Broken sword is an Adventure style game that follows the adventures of an American named George Stobbart in Paris.  While at a caf, he is nearly the victim of a bombing.  Driven by irritation at the fact that he was nearly killed and that someone died as well as a sense of adventure, he begins a private investigation into the bombing.  He is helped along by a young woman journalist named Nico.

What he finds is a conspiracy that stretches across Europe and holds within it, the secret of the lost treasure of the Templar knights.

Review:
I have played one of the sequels to this game and found it somewhat entertaining. When I found this game I thought it was worth giving it a try.  I was wise to do so as Broken Sword is easily one of the more entertaining adventure games I have played in some time. It's not an entirely serious game and has some somewhat comic moments. But it has a decent plot for an adventure game and enough of a hook to make the player want to keep playing to the end.

Graphics:
As a game released in the late 90's in the middle end of the Playstation's lifecycle, Broken Sword is something of a throwback. It boasts hand drawn backgrounds for its various locations. The characters are cartoonish sprites rather than 3d renders.  For this type of game, that is generally to be expected.

The game boast various cut scenes as well. These are cartoon animations, somewhat cheesy in nature, but staying in the same style as the character animations in the game itself.

Obviously, the Playstation graphics are not as nice as those found on the PC, given that the Playstation has a much lower resolution than the PC.  This does hurt the game a bit I'd say, but certainly the game is par for the course in terms of this type of game on the system.

Sound:
Broken Sword is fully voiced.  There are probably around 15 to 20 fully voiced characters. The major characters are well voice acted, though at times the sound quality seems a bit spotty.

Music and sound effects are mediocre.  This is not a strong point for this game.

Gameplay:
Gameplay in Broken Sword is traditional point and click adventure fare. This is actually the first time that I have played an adventure game on the Playstation.  Given that it was designed for a point and click interface, it easily could have gone horribly wrong. It doesn't, but it does have its moments.

Be sure to read the manual. It warns that the mouse cursor has three speeds, medium, which is the default speed, slow and fast.  The game moves the cursor more quickly by skipping pixels on the screen, which is still far slower than a computer mouse. The slow and fast modes are activated by holding the shoulder buttons on the controller.

I did not realize this at first. After dying in the game, I retraced my steps and for the life of me could not collect a critical object needed to advance.  The cursor needed to be within a few pixels of the object to detect it.  The default speed kept jumping over the item. It took a while to realize what was going on and use the shoulder buttons. This could be a potentially game breaking problem, though if players are aware, it's easy to overcome, though hunting the pixel will thus become more prominent.

There are also some points in the game where quick action is required or the player will die.  With a mouse, this would not be a problem, but with a controller, it can get tricky if you're unfamiliar with the controller or the game controls.  Saving your game often becomes a necessity as these points are game enders.  Thankfully, there are only a couple of them.

As a side note, this game is compatible with the PlayStation mouse if you have one. I have no idea if a mouse works on the PS3. I didn't actually try that.

Aside from the above, Broken Sword's puzzles are really not that difficult and for the most part, fairly logical. At only one point did I feel the need to use a walkthrough and I feel it was at the only point of the game where it wasn't clear that the action could be taken.  I would say that this game is a medium level difficulty game.

Story:
The plot of Broken sword is standard conspiracy theory stuff twisted in with some amount of real history. The Templar Knights feature quite heavily.  George Stobbart is a fun character with a dry wit and of course, Nico is appealing with her French accent.

Players travel all over Europe looking for clues and meet characters that are unique and memorable.  I seem to recall that this was the case with the other Broken Sword game I played. Characters were something developed quite heavily.

Some things seems to come just a little too fast for my taste. I felt there should have been more build-up for the revelation of the conspiracy and also, for the romance between Nico and George.

Bottom Line:
Despite being 12 years old, Broken Sword remains a fun game and a nice diversion. The puzzles are really not that difficult, especially for experienced players, and the story is solid enough to keep a player's interest.  Controller difficulties can be a problem at times, but forewarning can keep those to a minimum.  Playtime probably would average 8 to 12 hours depending on player.  4 stars",4.0,B00002STIE,A solid adventure game gets a turn on the Playstation,Video Games
"Kingdom Hearts is quite possibly the best game I have ever played.  I say this not as a casual, 15 minutes in a weekend gamer.  I say this as a gamer who, if absorbed and entertained enough, will spend a few hours of my weekend trying to get farther.
I have been a fan of Squaresoft since I first rented Final Fantasy 3 when it was first released on SNES.  I then proceeded to enjoy Secret of Mana and Secret of Evermore.  A few years later, I bought a Playstation and quickly acquired Final Fantasies 7 and 8 and Legend of Mana.  I also currently own Final Fantasies 9 and 10, and Final Fantasy Tactics.  These are simply a few of the great games I have bought, received as gifts, borrowed, and rented over my 16 years of life.
When I first heard about Kingdom Hearts, my reaction was the same as many Squaresoft fans, ""Squaresoft and Disney!  What are they thinking?!""  When I went to Amazon.com, however, to see what other gamers said about Kingdom Hearts, I found many people who shared my reaction, but had bought the game anyway, and all of them had given it five stars.  So I bought it.
There are so many things that make this game what it is.  For one thing it has a fantastic storyline.  Although it took stories from about 10 Disney movies, the story line in Kingdom Hearts is quite original.  Most of the movie plots were changed to allow for disc space and for the story of the game as a whole.
The voice acting is quite superb, especially the voices of Sora and the villain.  The game is made so that it can be enjoyed by all ages.  It has no ""mature themes,"" but is full of emotion.  The fighting is restricted to cartoon characters, and is not as violent as most other games of the genre now can be.  The action is enjoyable because it is always moving, action constantly continues unless there is a movie scene.
I just recently completed the game on normal mode.  As soon as ""The End"" came on the screen, I went and started again on expert mode, which, when I complete it, will give me access to hidden extras.  I rarely play games again; usually I will start on another even before completing the one I was playing before.",5.0,B000066TS5,Kingdom Hearts is supurb,Video Games

"Still the best wheel Logitech ever made, and that's after owning them all and years of experience.

I have an original DFP wheel, I have the G27, and I had a G25 as well.  None of them feel as good or as accurate as the DFGT... and the DFGT costs half as much as the G25/G27.  Plus the DFGT has those great extra adjustment buttons/wheel for tweaking car settings on the fly, very useful for games that want to force driver aids on you (sometimes you can use the DFGT to turn off ABS and such).  And the force feedback, wow it is so great that you can practically drive one-handed and have no problem countersteering accurately to save slides as your other hand is working the sequential shifter or something.  NO other wheel I've tried can do that (I've never owned anything from Thrustmaster though).

Of course the pedals are not so good - fortunately my dead G25 donated its pedal board to a re-wire so it will work with the DFP or DFGT.  That is a fantastic combination, and even on PC games where I could combine any wheel and pedals I want (e.g. DFGT wheel with Fanatec CSR Elite pedals) I eventually would come back to just using the modded G25 pedals - no load cell brake, but somehow the pedals just feel nice for my feet.

Do be careful with this wheel though - it tends to get a little loose around the middle after hardcore use.  You certainly don't want to have any percussive maintenance from game rage, it will not withstand very much of that since it's all plastic.

"I purchased this game for my 5 year old and I to play together due to the subject matter.  The game itself is nice and slow paced and really has no objectives other than leveling up from what I can tell.  You take care of and feed various animals to earn coins in order to unlock other types of animals, tools, food, habitats, etc.  The biggest problem with the game is the in-game instructions are pretty much non-existent, and if you have purchased a video game in the last 5 years, you know about the manual.  I have played video games for years on practically every home console ever made and found this difficult to figure out how to advance.

It still provides enjoyment for my children and I (ages 5 and 3), but in my opinion, there is no way for a younger aged child to figure out what to do.

"Many of the issues I have with this game have been clearly articulated by others. To sum up: over the top combat animations, lack of a tactical camera, excessive 'waves' of enemies during encounters, repeated (ad-nauseum) sterile environments, and pretty lame story (the unkindest comment I can give for a studio like Bioware).

For me though, the change to the art style from the 'antique baroque' of origins, to the 'sparse semi-anime cartoon' of DA2 was not a positive. Granted: appreciation of particular styles is entirely subjective. But for me, at least, I hated the bland and empty environments, the sadly comical take on darkspawn, and the uglification of the elves. The sole improvement was the redesign of the qunari who do look a lot badder (in a good way) than they did before. Although, even here, they do tend to look like clones of each other. Not sure if that's meant to be (lore) or simply more copy-pasting by the dev team.

If you played origins, be prepared for a more responsive combat experience (a plus IMO) but along with it be prepared for some absurd and ninja-clownish combat animations (especially if you like playing rogues). Amongst my favorites (not) are the exploding enemies (apparently darkspawn and people in DA2 are actually water balloons that explode on contact), and the cartwheeling in-place rogues (try THAT without a treadmill). And placing area-of-effect spells without a tactical camera on PC was a real PITA.

Also, the game features a new protagonist (Hawke) who is human only, but thankfully who can be either male or female. S/He is also fully voiced, unlike origins. Personally, I liked that. Your mileage may vary. The dialog interface is now a radial wheel featuring short paraphrases as options, like in Mass Effect, with the addition of icons to let you know that the dialog choice may lead to provoking a fight, pursuing a romantic plot, etc.  For myself, I'm neutral about the new system. Most others either love it or hate it.

The skill tree system in DA2 is one of the few genuine improvements over origins IMO. As is the option to make equipped helmets 'invisible' to the player so you can actually see facial expressions etc instead of endless shots of another stupid looking helmet.

Speaking of equipment, as it turns out, evey armorer in Thedas has apparently identified Hawke as the only customer whom they will design armor for. That's right, none of the items you find (aside from rings, amulets, and belts) can be used to equip your party members. Instead, you can purchase or find upgrades for their own distinctive armor. It leaves me cold personally, but it is a triumph of style I guess.

For me, the worst aspect of DA2 was the new take on the way you interact with your party members. In origins, you could initiate dialogue with your party members wherever you happened to be. In some contexts, the response was relatively limited, and in others, more options became available over time. And, of course, various locations triggered some other conversations as well. It was a mixture of player initiaive, situational triggers, and location/event triggers. In DA2, they have removed the ability to initiate conversation with your party members anywhere except in the party-member's home base. So basically, when I played through it felt like the party members ceased to be 'people' the moment you stepped away from their home base and simply became walking combat statistics. (To clarify, there are also still location-triggers for conversations too). Their personality was largely hamstrung IMO. And I guess it should be mentioned that many of them had a unpleasant personalities to begin with. One of the few bright points was being given the option to kill off two of them (but only near the end, and long after I'd begun praying for the option).

There were a lot of other problems with the game too: from a static 'world' that never felt alive in any way, to the absurdity of a mage pc casting spells in front of templars who showed not the slightest interest in the phenomenon, when the entire game revolves around the persecution of mages by the templars.

I think the reason I felt most sad about this game was that DAO was such a great game, and DA2 was a merely competant game. I felt little towards the party members, and even less towards the city of Kirkwall. It is the first time I've played a Bioware game and not loved the NPC's and the setting. The endless cutscenes, and the lack of player intiative in starting dialog, made it feel to me that while it was Hawke's story unfolding in the game, I was merely a button pushing bystander. Large gaps in the timeline exacerbate that feeling. Hawke starts each chapter encountering / talking to people he knows, but who you don't. After a bit, he ceases to feel like my avatar in the game world, and instead I'm left feeling more of a voyeur in his story. The story itself is almost completely linear, makes little sense in some spots, and has very little replayablity IMO.

I realize I've focussed primarily on the negative here and I don't want to leave the impression that I hated the game. The thing is it's hard to find positives when all you can feel is massive disappointment and when very few of the stylistic changes actually align with my own subjective tastes. I suppose I could give thanks for the lack of in-game DLC salesmen this time around?

For me it was a 'meh' game at best. I regret preordering it to get the signature edition bonuses. In retrospect, waiting to buy it at a lower price would have been the right move. I most certainly will not be purchasing any of the post-launch DLC for DA2. And more than likely I'll not be preordering DA3 given that the developer's new direction has so markedly and suddenly diverged from my own preferences.

If you like JRPG's, then I think you'll likely find DA2 to be more in line with your taste in gaming than I did. Otherwise, I'd recommend waiting to buy it once it hits bargain bins. I gave the game 3 stars, which I think is fair. It doesn't suck totally, but I certainly can't rank it anywhere near good or great games.",3.0,B003UF9E0O,Meh,Video Games

Sounds like any other game, but not Warhammer, just because it is so immersive and the new developments in what you can do and build are many making this the best thing since Red Alert.

The story however is a bit of a let down, a massively impressive opening sequence however with a little bit of back story but the cut scenes just get in the way of the action and you have a good idea of what you must do, get building, get creating, set up defense, make up a strategy and listen to the robots as they hail you to take them off to war as if they really want it. There is a nice change of character types, new items and places to explore. Although somewhat short it packs a whopping punch to boot.

Linear in terms of start here, finish there, all RTS games are nearly the same, save for Dungeon Siege, but that is another game altogether. Here the science fiction world of robots and armored killing machines meets orcs and space entities that all want a bit of your land. There is simply something new at every turn to ponder.

I am impressed by the quality of the battles, very smash 'em up with buildings going up in smoke, space jets flying around the place and giant robots mashing up an enemy mech squad, all pleasing to the eye but require a high end system to match the graphics.

If it is RTS you are looking for then WH40000 is really where it is at. The only disappointing aspect is that the backgrounds are either white or blue with no atmosphere which makes the low angle battle scenes look set against a giant blue bitmap that could have better. Still though, that aside, it is just a big mecha juggernaut of a RTS game that deserves the week or two you will get out of playing it now and again.

You will be into this more than men on horses chucking spears. Highly recommended.",5.0,B0001X64WO,Junk Total War for this,Video Games

"I had high hopes for this game. Plenty of awards, promising gameplay, and a new city (Chicago) to discover. I was drawn into the game initially based on those expectations, but as I played, I realized something. This game is boring.
If you liked grand theft auto (v or otherwise) then play that game for the driving and shooting stuff. The controls in Watch Dogs were uncomfortable, even after allowing a week of daily play to adjust to them. The driving was horrendous, and, I'll admit, I'm a terrible video game driver, but I much preferred the mechanics in GTAV and I didn't like those either. The ""snap to cover"" concept was poorly executed as well. One last thing and I'll stop complaining: the Pice de rsistance was supposed to be the hacking capabilities that the main character had. This, too, fell short for me and left me thinking that this hacking idea was more of a gimmick than an actual pivotal part of the game.
Okay, so I lied. The final thing in my diatribe, is the story. Never in all of gaming's history have I been so uninspired to play the story out. The characters were all cookie cutters from other stories and were too cliched and without any real depth. This is a REVENGE story, end of point. Nothing to see here; these are not the droids you are looking for. Move along. Move along.

Now I must say, the graphics were pretty impressive considering this was a game that was ported to previous gen systems like the ps3 and xbox360 as well as the ps4 and xbox one. The graphical prowess could've been more impressive, but it was very good from an ""old gen perspective"" which is all I really expected. However, the water's physics were very impressive, though it looked more like runny jello that Aiden was swimming in rather than actual water. I can't say too much else positive about this game...",2.0,B00BI83EVU,Crash Of The Hype-Train,Video Games
"Playing Deal or No Deal on your Wii is like watching the TV show in many ways, but less exciting in others.  A good part of the excitement on the show is the different personalities and Howie's comments to the people and all the silliness.  The voice of Howie Mandel is real in the game, but there's no way to have the interaction and the give and take that you have on the show.  That said, if you were playing the game with other people in the room watching in 1 player mode, or playing one of the custom games with up to 5 players, the conversation on your end might supply the party atmosphere that you see on the show.

Everything is otherwise much like it is on the show, with the audience, the banker, etc. and you can play with your Mii which I thought was kind of a nice touch.  The one thing I was not impressed with is the graphics.  Howie looks similar to the real Howie, but there are lots of ragged edges to the graphics.  They should be smooth.  I'm playing on a big screen TV and using component cables, but the graphics were rough enough that I went back to check my settings to make sure that I had it set to 480p instead of 480i.  For me, graphics in a Wii game don't have to be fancy, but the ragged edges are distracting.  Maybe on a smaller screen it would be less noticeable.  I posted some photos under the customer images, but it's kind of hard to see since they reduce the size here, but have a look anyway.

There are several options in the custom games that can be played with up to 5 players.  There's a Special Event where you can have from 2 to 13 $1,000,0000 cases.  There are also challenges in the 1 player mode like the Variety Ladder where your play one game of each special event type and try to win as much as you can, or Risky Business where you have to win increasingly larger amounts to keep playing.  In the Banker's Challenge you play 3 games in a row against computer opponents where the first game is against one, the second against 2 and the third against 3.  Again, you try to win as much as possible.

There are some mini games included such as Sharpshooter where you shoot the cases, Blackjack which plays like the card game but instead of 21 you're playing to $2,100 and instead of cards, you're dealt cases.  There's also a Marathon that has you playing each mini-game in random order, trying to score as much cash as you can.  It's probably good that they have the mini-games since playing Deal or No Deal would get boring after a while.

All in all, I think for the price it's a reasonably good game except I wish the graphics were more smoothly rendered.  I think it would be a good game at a party, even with only one player at a time because the interaction would make it more like the TV show.

"This mouse is a great companion, especially if you own an Alienware.  It will blend in perfectly as you can adjust virtually any color-scheme to match your computer.  Before you start, make sure to download SteelSeries software on their website as there is no disk included.

Controls and reaction time of each click is top-notch and precise.  This mouse is also very comfortable to use and click, as it has several side controls.  There was no issues with scrolling either.

Macro function is also very handy as it is easy to program a series of actions and assign it to any click.  Again, download a free SteelSeries software on their site to take advantage of all features.

You have 2 options:  Wired or wireless.  Either connect a braided(nice touch) USB cable to a charging cradle or directly to your mouse.  Cradle can have its separate color scheme as well.  However, there is one annoyance about this mouse that makes me grind my teeth: Its inconsistency and very short ""time-out"" when not in use.  If you come back to use your computer, after a while you literally have to switch the mouse OFF and ON again by doing so underneath the mouse.  Apparently ""Sensei"" likes to test my patience.

"I didn't get Guitar Hero or II, had i known it was this much fun i would have though.  I really love old 80's style hair metal and every time a new set unlocked in the game, I was tickled pink with what popped up new!

My first thought when playing my first song was.. wow, this is sort of difficult for me to get straight in my head.  I played guitar for about 14 years and used to play some of the songs in the game.  The odd thing that happened though is the controller feels like a guitar but the the fingers on my left hand want to do something else!  Oddly enough, I unlocked the Slash video and hey said basically the same thing and I didn't feel so crazy anymore.  He said that the game would be much easier for someone that had never played guitar before!  I'll have to agree.  But the cool part is, its not that hard to overcome.  You'll just have problems playing on the medium settings.

On Easy, you basically can just look at the colored dots and match them up to your buttons.  The problem I had on the medium settings is many passages in songs only wanted me to take actions 1/2 the time, but my brain knew how the song went from playing it on real guitar and I had a really hard time not picking every note that was supposed to be there.  Expert however tends to make you do something for every note so that part at least is easier.  The issue I notice on expert though is, somehow those 5 little buttons are harder to play than 6 strings and 24 frets on a real guitar!  The last song, Metallica ""One"" I used to play on guitar, I tried on expert mode in Guitar Hero III and I couldn't even come close to doing it!

Just like real guitar, if you want to play in expert mode, you're going to have to practice every song many times to get it.  I actually had quite a bit more fun playing on easy, there were quite a few songs where I felt immersed into the song and had the feeling as if I were really playing it.. that was really cool!  Expert mode, well reminded me of the days of learning a new song on the guitar.. except using 5 buttons and a strum paddle.  I'll tell ya.. I wish i could just plug my Strat into the Xbox and just play that way.  I would start practicing guitar again for the first time in 10 years and I'd know more about what i'm doing.

Dont get what I said so far wrong.  The fun factor on this game is huge.  My roomate that never has played guitar in his life, in fact, never really plays video games at all got into this game.  I can actually picture having a party and people fighting over who's next on this thing.

My hopes are that Guitar Hero III will bring rock guitar back and to a new level and hopefully spawn a new generation of guitarists!  Anybody that likes rock music, is going to love this game.

"Just got around to seeing what the hype is on this game.  The visuals are stunning!  I had a nice time just roaming around and watching the scenery.  The rides from city to city on the horses were alot of fun for me, but the Middle-Eastern names and storyline made it a little difficult for me to keep up with at first.  I really had to pay attention to know who was who.  Some subtitles would've been very helpful.  (Did I somehow miss those, because I sure did search)

Even though there are places to hide from guards, I never saw a reason to do it.  It was easy to kill them in large numbers without dying.  I think the game is too easy in that regard.  I had a few odd glitches also.  Sometimes Altair would freeze in battle while everyone else continuted on.  And there were times when horses would sink halfway into the ground when I approached them, or their hind legs would be stuck out horizontally.  If I sliced at them, they would run off with their legs still stuck in a horizontal position.  Very very odd.

This has to be the most redundant game I've ever played.  The first few missions are great, but it never changes.  You go to a city, you climb large towers to open up the area, you pickpocket, you eavesdrop, you look for flags, you get chased by guards, you go to the bureau to get orders, and you kill a major target.  The same thing. Over and over again.  It never gets any harder and it never changes.

"Let me start off by saying that I have played every single Smackdown series game except for Smackdown 1, and SvR 2007. I've also played the N64 greats such as No Mercy and Wrestlemania 2000. I only say this so anyone looking at this review will know i'ts the real deal and not some random guy who picked up the game and wants to point out all the bad parts without saying what is good.

Starting off, this game is tough. I think it's partly due to me switching consoles. I had played all the original Smackdown games on PS2, then from 2008-2011 I was always on Xbox so going to PS3 kinda threw me off. I had a pretty hard time fighting normal and easy mode AI bots. After a few games I realized that I was using the D-Pad to move which is actually the taunt button, and I was using right stick for grapples which is actually the X button. Anyway, after getting used to all the controls this game got a lot more fun. My only gripe is that it is hard to do reversals, but i'm sure i'll get used to it as I play more. But my biggest dislike is the way you kick out of pins. You have to hold the X button to move up a meter and stop it on a precise spot on that meter to kick out. Sometimes i'll lose a match early just because I mess up on accident. Again i'm sure i'll get past that.

Another downside (for me, a fan of the attitude era) is the horrible roster. The only good people you start off with are Triple H, Undertaker, and Kane. I do have The Rock which is great, and I have also unlocked Steve Austin who is my favorite wrestler. I used to watch WWF/WWE every week back around 1999-2004 then stopped because it got boring. I have nothing against people who like John Cena or Randy Orton but personally I think they're just boring and overrated. I'm glad I get Steve and Rocky, but I'd like to have some of the other legends.

The graphics are great this year, i'm pretty impressed. They seemed to have not put much thought/effort into Steve Austin though. He is without a doubt the greatest WWF superstar of all time and should have had more effort put into him. There is just something about him that doesn't look right to me.

There are two ring announcers from what I can tell. One of them is alright, and the other one is TERRIBLE. I don't know how this guy got a job at WWE. I guess i'm just nostalgic for Howard Finkel.

All the little cons here and there aside, this is a great game. You just have to put the effort into getting used to the controls and it's smooth from there.

----Update 11/24/11

I've now had the chance to play this game a bit more. Reversals are starting to get a little easier, you just have to really anticipate the opponents move, requiring a bit of skill rather than just pushing a button constantly. Kicking out of pins is a little easier for me now too, but I find that later on in a game when your guy is worn down it is pretty hard to do the kick out. I just wish you could do some button pushing instead of ONLY using the meter system.

I looked over another review that said the AI bots are too easy. Playing a little more, I now play on the hardest difficulty which is legend. I do find it easier than the maximum difficulties of the other games, but this game has a cool little option that can fix this. You can go into the options and increase the AI abilities. By this I mean simple things like raising their percentage of reversing your moves, and other things that make the AI harder. I would assume if you max everything out then you would have an unstoppable AI force.

Online play is pretty smooth, the WWE '12 team posted an update today that said they're fixing server issues that are causing lag. I'm glad the team is working hard on this. As usual, there are player matches and ranked matches. It kinda sucks that with the millions of people who get this game, you'll only see like 15 servers up at a time for each section.  I really recommend you to play offline and learn all the controls and be able to beat legend mode computers before playing online. I lost a few matches online to horrible players just because they could reverse all my moves and I sucked at it. I cannot stress enough that the reversals are hard!",4.0,B0053BQU4G,"Pretty good, hard to get started",Video Games

"After releasing a rather lackluster sequel, Red Octane redeemed themselves (and just in time too as Rock Star is around the corner) and presented the long awaited third installment in the Guitar Hero series, Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock. Don't get me wrong, its not that Guitar Hero II was a complete flop, it just didn't feel as inspired as the original Guitar Hero; most of the songs were re-makes, and some of them were pretty lazy ones at that. I know quite a few Guitar Hero fans who were quite disappointed with the second installment, and I have to admit that Guitar Hero II had half the magic that Guitar Hero one had.

Well, there's a new Guitar Hero in town, and this one is bigger and better than the rest of 'em. Guitar Hero III boasts over 70 tracks including such hits as ""Bulls on Parade"" - by Rage Against the Machine, ""Black Magic Woman"" by Santana, ""When you were young"" by the Killers, ""Suck My Kiss"" by the Red Hot Chili Peppers, ""Pride and Joy"" by Stevie Ray Vaughn and many more. A much better set list makes Guitar Hero III easily the best iteration yet, but the greatness doesn't stop there.

Guitar Hero III introduces the much anticipated and long overdue online play. Go head to head against a stranger in the new Battle Mode, or team up with a fellow rocker in online co-op.  The great thing about it is that there is minimal wait times; there is almost always someone ready to play either in battle match or the co-op.

The online interface is simple yet effective; you have a choice between Ranked and Player matches (ranked matches track your stats while player matches are for fun). The Player matches consist of Face-Off, Pro-Face Off, Co-OP and Battle. while  Ranked has all but the Co-op.

You can do a search for the first available match or you can create your own match. The ""join a quick match"" makes match finding easy, but you can also be nit-picky if you choose and set filters (difficulty, number of songs, type of match, ranked or player) for the search.

Like Guitar Hero II, when you are in a mutliplayer match with either a physical buddy or an online one, you can choose whether you want to play Bass guitar or Lead Guitar (and sometimes you get to pick Rhythm Guitar), and like Guitar Hero II you can each select your own difficulty (this especially comes in handy if you happen face off against someone who is a master of the Expert difficulty.

The control and star power are exactly the same as the last Guitar Hero, but for battle mode Red Octane has devised a cool gimmick. Instead of star power during a multiplayer battle ( or a boss battle, yes you get to battle ""bosses"" at the end of certain stages, like Slash from Guns N Roses and Tom Morello from Rage Against the Machine), you can earn power-ups that you can use against your foe. You can break their guitar strings, force them to use their whammy bar, up their difficulty, wreck their amplifier or block the view of their fretboard, making it near impossible to see the notes for a small period of time. You can also force them to play left-handed (this just reverses the button order).

I picked up Guitar Hero III on Saturday and I have been playing it non-stop. Tracks like ""One"" by Metallica and ""Striken"" by Disturbed are strangely addicting; I've played through medium, most of hard and the beginning of Expert. Online competitive play encourages me to keep my practice up and gives me more than enough reasons to keep hoisting your trusty old axe atop your shoulders for ""one more go"". Oh, and there are achievements galore, and they are HARD! Some of the achievements are standard fare (score this many points, or beat this difficulty), but others are darn complicated; one achievement requires you to beat ""Through the Fire and Flames"" by Dragonforce on Expert. For those of you who do not know this song, it is probably one of the most complex and THE most fastest guitar shredding song in the world. There are over 1500 notes in that song alone, and they whiz by in a flurry of blinding speed.

Like the other Guitar Hero's before it, III has a store where you can upgrade your guitars, buy new guitars, buy new characters, songs, videos and a download link to Xbox Live (no downloadable content yet, but there will be soon).

My only gripe with this game is the over saturation of in-game advertising; familiar brand names and logos litter the environments. Lets see, Pontiac, Red Bull, Zabian, Guitar Center and Axe body spray, just to name a few. I guess its not all bad though, because most of the songs on Guitar Hero III are the actual song and not a re-make. I have a feeling that the in-game advertising and the profits from Guitar Hero I and II helped with that.

"Though most of the game concept was lifted from GTA, it still manages to come up with some original flavor into it, thanks to the unforgettable characters that made The Godfather a classic. Amazingly, the game isn't just a drive around and do missions. It actually leaves you free to walk around and do things that will affect your business as a ""made-man"" with the Corleone family. Yes, you have to do the missions to keep the story moving but at the same time, you can ignore the missions and just go about doing other things to increase your ""business"" and contribute to the Corleone family. Take for example what I did in the game. I did about 50% of the missions and I decided to just clean-up Little Italy (where the Corleone family is based) from the Tattaglias; taking over these businesses, their warehouses.

One interesting mode in the game is the ""Mob War"" mode. This happens when you hit a crime family too much, they eventually declare a mob war with the Corleone family. Only to win a mob war is to either bomb one of their properties or pay an FBI agent to come down hard on the rival family. It's good fun really, and quite different. I usually bomb a place and then head to my apartment and let things calm down a bit. These fresh concepts  make this game quite unique in its way.

Speaking of families, you need to wrestle control of NY from all the other rival families. The biggest rival that you'll be pitted against is the Barzini family who owns Manhattan. By the way, the game recreates an almost perfect replica of New York, even the streets are accurate. I know because I'm from NYC. One trick I did to test the accuracy was fifth avenue and madison ave. Fifth avenue is just across Madision ave, which is correct in the game. Canal St. and Mott St. are real streets in NY, with Canal St. being Chinatown today.

Going back to what I am doing now with the game, I've basically knocked out Tattaglia from NY. Only thing left is go to and overrun his family compound. One important tip if you're planning to buy this game. The moment you get about $16,000 in the game, buy yourself the most expensive shoes, suits, hat, and glasses. These accessories give Bonus Respect points on your character. Very important if you want to get that extra boost of respect points to get to the top.

So is this game worth it? Yes definitely. If you are into mobster-themed games, look no further. This is almost almost real-life. By the way, prepare to die a lot in this game. This game is not easy. Be patient and keep buying those safehouses all over NY. This is where you can save your progress and start off in case you get ""ICED"".",5.0,B000930DLY,Take the Cannolis,Video Games
"How does wasting zombies at the turn of every corner sound? Pretty good to me! That's what you get when you purchase Resident Evil 2.  For those who have played it on the Playstation, you know what this is all about. The DC has finally put out the game series to keep it competitive. You begin the game by playing as Leon, a rookie cop for the Raccoon City PD, or Claire Redfield, depending on wich disk you put in. You and Claire are split up. You must find and fight your way to the Police Station. Once you are there, the real adventure begins. Solving puzzles and of course killing a bunch of zombies! I don't want to give all the details as to what you need to do or what you encounter. It would ruin the fun for you. The ""T"" Virus plays an important role in the whole situation. And don't forget, pay attention to the clues and read all diaries and faxes that you find! They are very important!  For those of you who have played Code Veronica on the Dreamcast, you will find some differences in this game. First the game play and control is the same. The disappointing things are the graphics are not as good as Code Veronica. Don't get me wrong, they are not bad, just not as good. That is why only 4 stars. Second, the game difficulty, I feel, is much eaiser than Code Veronica. I finished the game in about 8 hours. It took me about 36 to 40 hours to complete Code Veronica. It was a very entertaining and SCAREY 8 hours though!  The best part of this game is that it leads into Code Veronica and Resident Evil 3 very well. Why was this not released first?

"Quest 64 is a Role Playing game that stresses 3d eye-candy, with little depth of story, plot, and no long lasting appeal (all three are essential, along with others, for a good rpg).
The main character only has one weapon and a few items which most of which repeat themselves in a pattern throughout the entire game.
There are no side quests or red herrings to keep you intrigued, no easter eggs.
The battle system first of all is the most boring turn based combat system ive ever seen.  Oh and youll spend 80 percent of the game running around the countryside fighting monsters to build your levels (thats all the game's empahsis is on, building levels) and thatll bore you after about a couple of hours, off and on.  The game's story seems to get loss in the building of levels after the first few hours or so.
The amazing 3d graphics are the only thing really good about this game, as its the only thing that really keeps it from getting one star.  But still graphics don't make up for a game with such a linear monotonous flow.
I recently re-read some of the previous Nintendo Powers reviews of this game hyping it up as being as good as Final Fantasy series....that was a selling/promotional point more than anything else, since as the first editorial writer above said, ""Quest 64 sinks in too many areas: (to paraphrase him).

"Finally, KOEI has done it! They've made a DW deserving a new number! (6)
Keeping with the original Romance of Three Kingdoms (hai shi DW Three Kingdoms' new book The Greatest of Heroes) novel, they've made a game that brings incredible feelings of joy in playing through its characters in a totally new world to which say only Dynasty Warriors 3 can compare.

The new fighting systems, graphical environments AND their details eg shape of the land and interactivity, and enemy AI, all make the game something we've been waiting half a decade for.

It is truly beautiful - with 3rd gen console quality cutscenes (and real voice actors now!) the story is vividly retold, threading together the historical battles of ROTK (half the reason for the games' popularity and KOEI's success!). With this formula reinvigorated, KOEI should now win over millions more to its series with the Chinese story, which have complemented each others fame in recent years.

The combo ""Renbu"" system is a nice change, allowing more powerful attacks as you show your skill rather than button mashing ability, and the game allows enough foes on screen for it to become worthwhile.

Having a new skill system, although copied from other games, is one of the wisest ideas KOEI has had. The warhorse and weapon development are some of the ways that makes the games' time consumption feel more worthwhile, but the only critisiscm is still just that - time consumption. It's a long game (but based on a very long story! - ROTK is 3x as long as Lord of the Rings!) and with dozens of characters to play through and level up, its one that can accomodate the casual player but even better the DW/ROTK addict.

So overall, an incredible game - the kind we've been waiting for.

I'd give it 9/10 - the best since DW3.

The chinese online version is still the kind we are waiting for however - where the mechanics and joy of Dynasty Warriors can be applied against HUMAN opponents - but until then this will suffice.

In the meantime however, DW Three Kingdoms has also released their new book, based on the same story as Dynasty Warriors, and is a great compliment one of the best games of 2008.",5.0,B00104KJ4W,"Finally, a Dynasty Warriors worth buying and playing through!!",Video Games
"I bought this at christmas and it was on sale at $15 and was totally worth it, and also the base game was $20, but there are some things that I didn't like.  First of all, the cons. This is not much of an expansion, all of the features that this expansion has, they were supposed to include them in the sims 3 base game. Second con, it takes a lot of time to play the game and to actually fall in love and then get married a lot of time, I'm totally not kidding.

I created a character, which took like 30 minutes, then it took me 3 more hours to make the house like I wanted. Then it took like an hour to figure out cheats and how to play better. Then My character meets somebody, falls in love, then it turns out that that character has a dream goal of breaking as much hearts as he can. So I had to figure out a way to make him fall head over heels with me or figure a cheat to control him and change his goal in life *which I did lol*. Then, I lost interest in the game and stop playing...  As you can see, it's a lot if you're playing for the first time, if you buy this expansion be sure to buy another one, because it takes a lot of hours to really see it.

The positive!

Now I had so much fun making a love story, and playing that I started playing again. You can get married(gays can get married too),have a bachelor party, have kids send them to boarding schools (and never seeing them again until they turn 18 years old) , they can fall in love too, make pranks, play with them in the tree house *which you can never see inside*, you can also videotape, get fat, have a midlife crisis *which is actually a lot of fun, with a certain cheat you can have more than one midlife crisis ),you can have a reputation and everyone else can speak about you *like in real life lol*.

"First let me preface that I have played the past 3 game in the series (original release), although not much of the uncharted formula has changed; it's still an exhilarating experience to behold.  There isn't a huge leap like from Uncharted 1 to 2, but what makes Uncharted 4 standout from 3 is the graphics, combat variation, and more natural character interaction whether its from Nathan Drake talking to other people or mumbling to himself through his adventure instead of making a lot of one liners.

Graphics one of the best on PS4 so far. Very life like especially with the grass/leaves growing around and out of buildings. They always seem to pop when traversing the landscape. The animation and movement of the characters are very organic to how Nathan lands on his feet after a jump or miss jump to the slight body movements when he tries to get back on balance when someone shoves him from the back or shoulder.

Story revolve around Nathan Drake's brother coming back in his life, and asking for help to find a hidden lost treasure. There's a lot more cutscenes and introspection in terms of story telling compared to previous games. The pacing is a bit out of place and there a lot of highs and lows in terms of action sequences, flash backs, puzzle segments and level traversal. Instead of sprinkling them out, they tend to do it more in bulk in this game, which sort of discourages binge gaming.

Gameplay. Instead of scaling up buildings to reach the next destination every time, there's awesome wide traversal in the game making it a nice change of pace with a larger view of the world instead of a narrow upward momentum in past games. There's a new rope swing mechanic where you wall walk and swing around corners with enhances exploration.

Seeing the wider open landscape there's more options to attack your enemies during combat segments as you no longer have to fight through narrow corridors and feel trapped, hiding behind boxes while you constantly shoot a bullet sponges. Now to can easily flank and traverse around characters as well as stealth kill you way to the next checkpoint without initiating a breakout fight. The AI use the larger levels to their advantage as well, so the game encourage you keep moving instead of staying in one fixed location.

There are vehicle traversal segments to switch things up a bit, but I find the vehicle controls horrible and should have been omitted from the game, but the landscape you ride around has really nice vistas. Just that tight corners and narrow passages ways kills the mood when driving in them.

Partner AI is very good in this game. They react to your overall intent whether it's stealth taking out your enemies or letting you crawl pass them when climbing buildings.

Online is similar to Uncharted 3's multiplayer except  there's a supernatural element to it where you can use items called mysticals to call in snipers, pin point all enemies on the map, and teleport among other skills.

Trophies are similar to past games: do certain actions/use weapons a set amount of times, collect relics, complete game on variety of difficulty settings. etc. If you tried trophy hunting in Uncharted 1-3 it will feel familiar to you.

Overall, not the major change I was hoping moving into a new console, but a enjoyable Uncharted experience nevertheless 4.5/5",5.0,B00GODZYNA,"Minor Tweaks to the Uncharted Formula, still a great game",Video Games
"After more than ten years of waiting, the follow-up to one of the most successful and well-known crossover gaming franchises at last arrives. Marvel VS. Capcom 3 breaks into the scene facing a great deal of expectations and anticipation, and in most aspects it delivers, but unfortunately it falls just a bit short of being the spectacular game it could have been.

The gameplay and general mechanics are essentially a mishmash of those from both Marvel VS. Capcom 2 and Tatsunoko VS. Capcom. You're given three characters and a series of four core buttons to work with, those being Light, Medium, Heavy and Special attacks. This closely resembles the setup of TVC, simplifying things a bit from the punch and kick commands of MVC; a wise move, given that it generally trims the fat of the previous game's complexity.

The Assists, Hyper Combos, crossovers and many other advanced tactics all return, but there are a handful of new alterations and quirks. For one, unlike TVC, there is no Mega Crash (although it is possible to break away from certain long combos) or Baroque; instead, there's the X Factor, a completely new tactic that may only be used once per match. X Factoring allows each of your characters a brief speed and power boost, along with gradual health recovery. These effects are strengthened depending on how many of your 3 characters are remaining (it is at its maximum if you only have one character left). This occasionally adds an interesting element to the gameplay, but many have argued that it's an unnecessary feature which can unfairly turn the tide of a fight, and there is definitely some validity to this complaint. Adding to the imbalance of this is the fact that different characters receive different boosts, leading to some characters gaining ridiculous power boosts while others don't really become much more of a threat.

Switching out, or swapping characters, is unfortunately now a sorely obnoxious task, requiring the player to press and hold the Partner button until their other character appears; mistakenly tapping the button will cause a crossover Assist, and as many veteran players know, initiating an Assist when you're intending to switch out can cost you a character, or worse, a match. Needless to say, this can take a bit of getting used to, particularly for those accustomed to the simple back+/Partner command that came before.

`Simple mode' from TVC also returns, allowing a significantly simplified control scheme in which special moves and Hyper Combos can be more easily initiated. This may sound unappealing or unfair to those more willing to adjust to the traditional controls, but simple mode also disallows certain attacks and abilities, so it's more of a tradeoff than a wholehearted handicap; it's ultimately a more accessible and user-friendly version of the control scheme.

The roster has been among the most debated-over aspects of the game; MVC2 had a whopping 56 characters to choose from, while so far MVC3 only offers 36. Granted, unlike MVC2, you'll find no recycled sprites here; each and every character is brought to vivid new life and design. Many staples and favorites return, so fans of Ryu, Wolverine, Morrigan, Storm, and many others won't be complaining. Devil May Cry's Dante and X-Men's Deadpool are among some of the exciting new additions, while a surprising number of more obscure fan favorites also managed to make the cut. Some of the exclusions are rather upsetting, however, particularly the lack of Venom, certain X-Men characters and most shocking of all, Capcom's flagship character Mega Man. There's more downloadable content to come, however, so we'll have to see what the game's future has to offer.

Some of the game's modes and single-player options are more disappointing than others; the online mode is overall pretty satisfying so far, allowing players to either log on for a quick match with a random player or friend, or join a lobby of several players in a sort of informal tournament system. Players can `friend' opponents they'd like to play again and even speak to one another through console-compatible microphones. Lag is generally minimal or non-existent, and thankfully you'll be forewarned of the connection strength in the lobbies before joining. There are also of course leaderboards and rankings for the best of the best, but you can only gain ranks through random Quick Matches, and sadly there's no spectator option; this is particularly frustrating when you're waiting around for your next match in the lobbies.

The single-player modes aren't quite as satisfying. MVC3 has a rather standard Arcade mode which features nothing but a series of random battles followed by a boss fight and usually anticlimactic ending sequence which differs by character but is merely a brief series of still pictures and text. The end-game credits are nice the first time you watch them, but they're the same regardless of which character you win with, and therefore aren't nearly as interesting the second, third or fourth time around. Super Smash Bros. Brawl's Subspace Emissary wasn't what a lot of people were hoping for, but it was more engaging than what's offered here. Although the Arcade mode serves its generic purpose, a few more cutscenes or character-specific individuality would've made it really worthwhile.

MVC3's biggest asset is it succeeds in a few of the key areas where both TVC and MVC2 failed. TVC offered an overly simplified control option which occasionally allowed for disproportionate advantages, and yet was oftentimes preferable to the needlessly complex alternative. MVC3 manages to find a healthy balance between MVC2's ice-cold complexity and TVC's desperate attempt at accessibility; both regular and simple mode in MVC3 are useable without being cheaply advantageous or impossible to understand. Although deeply advanced tactics will be reserved for deeply skilled players, as they always have been, most players will gain a deeper understanding of the control schemes offered here more quickly than they would have in MVC2.

Unfortunately, as expected, opportunities to be cheap present themselves in MVC3 just as they do in most fighting games. Thankfully only a small handful of the characters seem genuinely broken or overpowered, but the ones that are can be truly frustrating to go up against; both Sentinel and Iron Man can fill the screen with enormous and heavily damaging beams and projectiles, while Phoenix becomes virtually impossible to approach, let alone defeat, once she transforms into Dark Phoenix. Ryu spammers are also expectedly back in action, but thankfully so far it doesn't seem quite as common as it was in TVC.

The game has a visual style that is distinctly American and heavily influenced by comic books; as where MVC2's artwork and aesthetics felt more authentically Japanese, this game comes off as though it belongs a little more to Marvel than it does to Capcom. This works both for and against it; most of the Marvel characters look amazing, and several of the Capcom ones do as well, although the heavy Americanization of the likes of Tron Bonne and Morrigan can come off as a bit wonky at first. Aside from that, however, the visuals are vivid and gorgeous; one thing you'll never be bored with is what goes on onscreen during matches.

Although the complaints may have seemed heavy, MVC3 is in fact a very entertaining and visually appealing game; the online mode is extremely fun and engaging, and some of the downloadable content to come, namely the new characters and complete costume revamps, seem very promising. Tuning up the roster and 1-player mode-adding more modes in general, for that matter-would have really made it nothing short of excellent, but here's hoping they really take popular demand into consideration for DLC.",4.0,B003IEBO9Q,"Great game, but not entirely what it could have been",Video Games

"""Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem"" was a truly pivotal piece of gaming back in 2002.  The deep mythology, the unnerving ambience, the easy-to-learn gameplay, the ""Sanity"" effects...

...but some years have passed.  I have revisited the dark tale in order to once again discover its brilliance.  But the simple truth is that ""Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem"" is a product of its time, and was put on its pedestal way too soon.

I am not writing this review to simply analyze the videogame's faults.  Frankly, there are ton of 5-star games available on Amazon that are well worth your time and money in spite of their flaws.  But with ""Eternal Darkness"", you must tread carefully.  You are reading the reviews of memories, not the review of the game as it is in 2009.

I guess the best summary I can give you is that for every great idea in ""Eternal Darkness"", there's always some sort of caveat to remind you that you're holding a controller in your hand.  So, my personal review is going to be a ""This Is Good, But"" kind of review.  Let's bullet-point this one, shall we?

* The game's combat is much simpler and easier than most survival-horror games.  You will often control a sword, or other form of blade, with the occasional pistol or projectile thrown in.  Frankly, the guns are worthless.  The game will quickly teach you how to take down your enemies.  BUT ""better"" doesn't mean ""great"".  The combat leaves much to be desired.  Even with the magic system (more on that later) implemented in the later stages of the game, you are still hacking and slashing some pretty boring-looking foes.

* ""Eternal Darkness"" is famous for its sanity effects.  Whenever your character is spotted by the enemy, you slowly lose your sanity, which can eventually lead to some very frightening moments.  I'll leave those moments for you to discover, which I'm sure are on YouTube in case you wanna pass the game up.  BUT, other than eventually harming your health, these sanity effects get old once you've seen them.  The only way to really enjoy them is to deliberately delay killing your enemies.  Some may get a delightful cackle from going nuts, but it's not THAT genius when you think about it.

* The game uses a magic system in order to not only enhance combat, but to solve some nifty puzzles.  As the game progresses, you learn more spells, and can make them more powerful.  There's even a Ro-Sham-Bo kinda system to the magic.  BUT, learning the spells is kinda cheap.  In order to create spells, you need Runes.  In order to use the runes, you need to decode them.  Learning the spells requires little to no thought whatsoever, because you learn them by just searching for different pieces throughout the stages.  Because you take little part in creating the spells, learning them is tedious.

* ""Eternal Darkness"" has a mythology and story that spans centuries.  You will play as various characters who've encountered a supernatural evil, leading to moments of sheer horror.  BUT this method of storytelling means you only get a brief adventure with the characters.  Their histories, their dreams, their motivations, their effects in time...you will learn less than you hope.  It becomes very apparent that main character Alexandra Roivas is merely someone who just finds their different stories in her family mansion.  You want to know more about how her grandfather was mysteriously & gruesomely murdered.  Instead, you begin reading the stories of others, waiting a long time before Alex is personally involved.

* The game featured some great graphics for its time.  The levels in particular look pretty sharp even today.  I never understood the criticisms for ""Resident Evil"" graphical presentation, because it immerses you in artistic creation.  The environments (except for the Persian desert) are uniformly strong.  BUT, the character models aren't consistently good.  Some look amazing in closeup, while people look blocky.  Some are very well-animated in their movements, while others move like constipated apes.  Even the corpses aren't consistently drawn well.

* Sound plays a major role in this game, and it's the only near-perfect element in the game.  The music is subtle and minimal.  The screams are terrifying.  The shocks are heart-stopping.  The voice-acting is excellent.  The weapons sound good.  The creatures are intimidating.  What's most remarkable is the background & surround effects.  Early in the game, you're in a monestary where if you approach an office, you can hear a muttered secret meeting taking place.  Other than maybe the Roivas mansion's ""gong-gong"" rhythm, I've no complaints here.

* The game has three different endings.  BUT, the differences are mostly cosmetic, and minimal at best.  Finishing all three versions of the quest will unlock the ultimate ending for the game, but the drive to complete the game three times is questionable.

* ""Eternal Darkness"" has some good scares in it, some of them ""BOO"" moments, others just disturbing.  BUT, while disturbing moments leave long impressions, this game is only as scary as you want it to be.  Once you go through the jump-out-of-your-seat moments, you're not likely to be scared on your second playthrough.  And going back to the sanity effects, only you are in control of how mad your character gets.  Sadly, there are only a few moments when the player doesn't control the sanity...those are the best surprises.

I first played ""Eternal Darkness"" in July 2002.  I thought it was extraordinary.  If I had done an official review, I probably would've said 9.5 out of 10.  To this day, most critics' reviews average out to that score.

A few years later, I popped the game back in.  I finished the game, but somewhat reluctantly so.  I put the game aside, and told myself, ""Maybe I'm just not in the right frame of mind to enjoy this fully.  Another time, perhaps.""  After all, some great games can't be played on a regular basis, and need time to grow in your memories before you revisit them.

So, now it's 2009.  I have tried a third time to play ""Eternal Darkness"" from start to finish.  About halfway through, I have decided to stop.  It's just not that fun anymore.

There is nothing shameful about a videogame that pioneered a genre years ago, and has fallen by the wayside.  Our memories are real.  We really did enjoy the worlds, tales, and experiences that ""Eternal Darkness"" gave us years ago.  But it's time to acknowledge that its core value as a videogame is diminished.

If I may quickly sidestep, one of my all-time favorite series is the ""Metal Gear Solid"" franchise.  Those have much more emphasis on story & cinemas than they do on actual gameplay.  But the differences is that those stories are brilliant, a pleasure to revisit, and the gameplay itself holds up in the time passed.  ""Eternal Darkness"", on the other hand, has a good story that isn't worth playing through.  I loved the end, but don't like getting there anymore.

""Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem"" belonged on its pedestal in 2002.

"Dark Souls 1 is hard to match.  It was not only a subtle improvement over the systems and design of Demon's Souls, it was this huge, intertwined word to explore.  When the game is over, much of what stays with you in Dark Souls was the atmosphere and the feeling of going on a journey. I never got that from Dark Souls 2.  The 60 FPS Scholar of the First Sin release made the game a lot smoother to play, but there were some gaping design problems. Even after 100+ hours, I never warmed to the trash mob design philosophies or world design. Also, F*** the Fume Knight. Seriously though, Dark Souls 2 may have been HUGE and challenging, but it just wasn't as charming or fun as the original. And why were backstabs so hard to pull off? Dark Souls 3 knows this.

The Bloodborne influence is evident early on. The game simply LOOKS like Bloodborne - mostly for the better. Enemy placement is far more thoughtful and the game controls far better, faster even. The backstab is now a cinch to do most of the time, even on some bosses. And the bosses are mostly good too, if not quite original. This is a sequel after all and for better or worse, there are TONS of Dark Souls 1 callbacks. TONS, I tell you. The Bloodborne DNA is mostly welcome, but there are some things missing.  Yharnam, like Lordran before it, was a giant sweeping and intertwined place of mystery.  It felt lived in.  There were signs of other days long past.  You walked among not just ruins, but places where things actually happened.  Lothric easily trumps Drangleic in this atmospheric respect, particularly in High Wall and Undead Settlement. Overall though, variety is missing here.  This is a great sequel and the gameplay is better than it has ever been and that alone is worth the price of admission.  But the world isn't quite as interesting and the bosses not nearly as surprising.  Dark Souls 3 is a much better game than Dark Souls 2.  But it isn't quite as good as Bloodborne or the original.  This is like Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade: Missing the magic from the original, but a solid improvement over Temple of Doom.

Some notes:

- Beat it. Missing only Nameless King fight to clear out. Completely satisfying, but slightly shorter than Bloodborne overall.

- Having the game both on PC and PS4, crashes aside, the PC version plays vastly superior.  The 60FPS frame-rate make combat far more satisfying.  Get this one if you have the choice.

- Summon co-op occasionally makes for easier boss fights, but it also makes Dark Souls 3 more fun to play.  Don't think you're ""Cheating"" by bringing in a phantom or playing the phantom helper yourself. Teamwork has it's own rewards.  Co-op leads to many tense and often hilarious encounters topped off with some emote banter.

- Some boss mechanics are recycled in a few places, particularly with the duo encounters.  Also having a boss recharge their health meter mid fight isn't fun.
- Rings and covenant grinding for trophies is pretty tedious.  Just outright boring really. Chances are I'm going to just bail on the Platinum grind.  I got my money's worth.

EDIT:  Three, playthroughs down on two systems.  A level 134 character on NG+ and someday I may get that Dark Soul achievement.  Dark Souls 3 was worth the time - with some network glitches that have popped up.  Occasionally if you are summoned for a boss fight, you walk around like a statue and take no damage from the boss while pummeling them with DPS.  It's a weird glitch I think is down to network lag.  Only have seen it two or three times, but should be addressed.  Kind of takes the wind out of a fight if it takes no effort to win.

****
Final EDIT:  Six clears. 200+ hours. Hanging it up on DS3. 88% trophy completion. I just don't have the heart to clear the PvP grind for spells and another NG run for rings.  By far most value of any game this year. My time was respected and it was fun and far less frustrating than I remember DS2.  At the end of the day, Bloodborne is still better, but DS3 is a truly great game.",4.0,B00Z9LUFHS,The Last Crusade,Video Games

"Imagine: you round a corner, minding your own business, when suddenly you're faced with three guards, swords on their backs and automatics in their hands, ten meters away. How unfortunate... for them. You effortlessly intercept the incoming arms fire with your sword as you rapidly close the distance, and drive your assailants back with a flurry of blows delivered almost too quickly to follow. You take to the air then, and savage your opponents with a barrage of precisely aimed shurikens as you pass overhead. Finally, you stride off the wall twice, bringing you behind the three, and as you turn, your sword screams around in a lethal arc, decapitating all three of your hapless attackers with a single, fell stroke. By the time you hit the ground, you're the only one left alive. Elapsed time: six seconds. Sound impossible? Not if you're a ninja.

The above is only one example of the countless spectacular feats you'll find yourself performing as Ryu, the protagonist of Ninja Gaiden. It took less than a minute for me to become obsessed with this game, as I learned how Ryu could flip through the air, stride up and across walls, dance across the surface of water, perform all manner of aerial acrobatics, and of course, deal out death in any way you can name, and more than a few that you can't. Playing the part of Ryu is wonderfully fun, and with the intuitive control scheme, it's surprisingly easy to get into as well.

The game's visuals are astounding, some of the best I've seen on the XBox. Its numerous and diverse locales are all very convincingly rendered, as are the various characters that populate them, making for a highly immersive experience. Everything clips along at an excellent frame rate as well, with nary a moment of slowdown to be found, even when you're fighting five guys at once and they're breaking out the incendiary shurikens. The sound effects and the score are excellent as well, spanning a wide variety of themes and always fitting the game perfectly. The voice acting could have been a little better, perhaps, but it's not bad... certainly it's no Resident Evil, so you needn't fear on that count.

One thing a lot of people have mentioned about the game is that it's quite difficult, and it is, but I count that as a point in its favor. Ninja Gaiden gets the challenge factor just right, in my opinion: it's challenging enough that it will require real skill, and multiple attempts at some of its harder battles, but not so challenging that the difficulty detracts from the fun of it. One need only have a little patience, and before long you'll be handling multiple foes and stringing complex combos together like you've been doing it your whole life.

With a superb array of weapons to employ, a numberless horde of foes to engage, a fine variety of secrets and extras to discover and unlock, and such a wonderful world to play in, I'm hard-pressed to imagine what more one could want from an action game. This is ninja mayhem at its finest, ladies and gentlemen, and I strongly suggest that you don't miss out on the fun.",5.0,B00008KTNW,Spectacular!,Video Games
"Honestly, I'm the worst gamer there is. I have about 6 games and I'm stuck on all of them. This game I was actually able to play through. It has a little of everything. Driving, chasing, fighting, shooting, questioning. It's all there. If you mess up, you mess up. The best part about it for me is if I can't get through an action scene it allows me to either skip it or continue trying. I totally need something like that.

Being able to play though it really makes it fun for me. Plus, I love all the achievements I can get during the game play.

I was actually able to play through this game one time and because I didn't do so well on questioning in the beginning I can play though again and try to answer the questions correctly. Plus, I still have more hidden vehicles to find as well as more crime chases that are side scenes to the actual case you're working.

I have to say, I really enjoyed this game. I hope they come out with many more just like it!

"This review's late to the party, but I'll chip in my family's thoughts in case there are any other Wii-owning Cars fans out there still on the fence about this one.

To put it short: Cars fan? Buy this. Not a Cars fan? Nothing here for you.

Let's face it, young or old, you don't buy a CARS game expecting Gran Turismo. You buy a CARS game because you like the characters, and you enjoy the unique experience of racing around in a living, breathing (they don't have lungs, but they definitely inhale and exhale) automobile while other vehicles taunt you and Doc Hudson offers encouragement over the radio. In what other race game can you play as an aging Sheriff car who--as the race begins--sighs, ""Am I getting too old for this sort of race? I sure hope not."" Then, after pulling off a tight maneuver, chuckles ""I didn't know I could still do that!"" and, upon winning, declares ""Sit-choo-ation is under control."" (Or, in a loss, grumps, ""This is a complete and total disgrace!"") These cars have personalities. Their mood changes depending on their place in the race, they whoop with joy when catching big air, and they yelp when they hit obstacles. THAT is why ya buy a CARS game, and this game delivers that element in great generous heaps of humor and fun.

If you're a huge fan of the movie, you'll enjoy this game a lot. You'll just learn to avoid the problem areas and spend more time with the sections that work great.

PROS:

* Better controls this time around--Wii Wheel works great with this one.
* Sheriff's a playable racer again!
* Sharp graphics
* Radiator Springs Speedway is a fantastic track & environment.
* Tons of gameplay.
* Huge environments to explore.
* The banter between cars is as entertaining as ever.
* Power Boost and Backwards Driving available from start.
* Some fun new characters (Bubba's awesome).
* Slick menus.

CONS:

* Framerate gets AWFUL when many cars are ahead of you in busy environments. This is, by far, the game's worst flaw. Stay in first place, and it's not an issue!
* Terrible pop-in scenery in Tailfin Pass area. Ugly, ugly trees will appear just yards ahead of you. And you'll wish they'd just stayed unseen.
* Story's not very compelling. The generic little cars that make up the competing schools are not very interesting as playable characters.
* Sound glitches crop up during Pre and Post-race info windows--these moments have a rough, unpolished feel to them.
* Still no replay camera feature.

That framerate issue will be the deal-breaker for a lot of players. It's very inconsistent, and seems to depend on how hard the environment is pushing the Wii's limits. The opening races on Radiator Springs Speedway play fairly smoothly, while later areas like Tailfin Pass and Santa Carburera suffer greatly. If you stay out if front, no problem. If more than three or four cars get ahead of you, prepare for framerate chaos. I guess you could view that as your punishment for racing poorly! Despite those problems--and the terrible pop-in trees in Tailfin Pass--the game, in general, looks great. The cars are detailed and sport nifty reflective effects, and everything has a sharp, detailed, colorful look. I wish the developers had been given more time to tweak the game engine to run more smoothly on Wii--maybe dropping some detail to save the frame rate during crowded situations, and redesigning Tailfin Pass, which is clearly asking more of the Wii than the poor little white box can pull off.

 BUT...and here's the good news...IF you can overlook those cringe-inducing moments, there's still a ton of fun to be had in this installment of the Cars franchise, because most of the game plays well, looks great, and delivers all the charm and personality you're looking for in a Cars game.

Besides, the framerate isn't always an issue. Most circuit races play fine, Free Driving is a pleasure, and the Rustbucket and Monster Truck races are entertaining and smooth, as are the fun little Guido Kart mini races and Sheriff's chase. Another trick is to switch to first-person camera, which not only increases the framerate, but provides a genuinely thrilling sense of speed.

Add in the Point-to-Point races, Relays, Tractor Stampede and the shallow-but-fun Car-Toon Challenges and you've basically got a Cars theme park on a disc. It's got some glitches, but most of it will make Cars fans smile.

"The short answer: Game of the Year.

There you go, no need to read further. You're wasting valuable playing time.

For those with a bit more of an attention span: Game of the Year --- because ---

While it seems at first glance that Fallout 3 might just be Oblivion reskinned, spending a little time with this game will dispell that notion completely. Yes, it's made by Bethesda and if you've played their earlier RPGs Morrowind and Oblivion you will see a lot of similarities and will definitely feel right at home with this game. But the similarities quickly fade into mere recognizable structural convention as the player begins to see that there is a rather stout and unexpected FPS mixed with their RPG.

Okay RPG players it's not going to be all mindless or super difficult finger twitching gun battles --- you are thinkers --- well the VATS system is only one button away and you can take a half an hour to pick a limb, body, or head shot if that's how you wish to play. All the strategy of leveling up, what powers to get, weapons to get, and what armor etc. are still there --- there's even a very lite version of co-op play if you find the right characters.

And to the skeptical FPS players --- I've played 'em all --- all the Halo games, Far Cry, Bioshock etc. etc. etc. --- whatever --- and this is as smooth and solid as any of those games as a shooter. I repeat, smooth and solid. But when you want a little extra sauce on your kills, once again, the VATS system is the answer for you as well. Very satisfying slow motion ultra-gory head explosions and full utilization of the Havoc psychics engine are just a button push away. Really that's nothing but pure fun.

This is an extremely detailed and fascinating world that is brought to life with great care, ambition, and talent. Also, as simple and predictible as the story might be, I found myself actually following it and often being amused by it instead of completely ignoring it on my way to the next action sequence. I swear, I have no idea what's going on in Halo for example --- nor do I care.

And lastly, for the Fallout 1 and 2 players --- you probably won't think anything will be as good as those games. But really this game has captured a lot of the flavor those games --- while attaining a very next generation playability --- besides we need to move into this century now. Here's a tissue.

Bethesda, Nice effort on this outstanding game and also on the excellent collectors edition --- cool bobble, art book, video, and lunch box. My favorite CE so far.",5.0,B0016BTNTQ,Oblivion Reskinned or Game of the Year,Video Games

It's written much like a long interactive episode of the TV show. The controls are pretty good and the graphics are also okay. I like how the world is set up.

The graphics are to be expected of the console generation. Gameplay is very one sided. Ammo drops everywhere and a bundle of heavy explosives on at all time doesn't make a large challenge. Or you can just swing your hammer over and over.

"This game is a blast!

Graphics: The graphics of the girl wrestlers are the best I've seen of computer woman anywhere. They claim they used 10,000 polygons per character, and it shows; whole body frame moves from breathing, breasts sway, hair flows, you can even see the fat on their bodies. Its hard to believe this is done on a PS2. One disappointment is the mud pit (which is more like muddy water) but they got the most important thing right, the girls. I just wish that they had included a bigger variety of body types; a few women who were a little older or maybe a little heavier would have been interesting.

Wrestling: The game works well and is a lot of fun. Some people have complained about the low number of moves, but actually each girl has dozens of moves, because the most of the holds and throws have a different effect when you are moving, or just after an evasion move, etc. The only problem is that the reversals are damn near impossible to pull off, and since you can't rotate the camera in a match, sometimes its hard to see the game properly. The game tracks your energy to pull off special moves, your body damage, and your ""humiliation"" rating. It can seem complicated, but you can ignore all that if you want to. Just wrestle the best you can, and the rest takes care of itself.

Arenas: There are only 4 different arenas to choose from (including the mud pit). A few more venues would have been nice. Except for the mud itself, the arenas look great.

Story: As others have said, the story mode is badly acted and quite ridiculous, but the dialogue is funny so I didn't care. You have to take it with a sense of humor. Each wrestler's story is a little short, but since there are 20 or so wrestlers to go through, there is a huge amount of gameplay here.

Also, the game uses a very nice feature, where, by using certain moves in a ""vow"" system, you can change the face/heel rating of your wrestler, in effect, turning toward good or evil. This changes the personality, costume, wrestling moves, and story for each character. My favorite is the schoolteacher who can be unlocked as a dominatrix.

Extras: Since the women are so gorgeous, there is a gallery mode where you can rotate the camera and zoom in and zoom out while the women stretch out and answer interview questions. Its something that didn't have to be added, and its actually pretty cool.

Entrance: This is something I haven't seen anyone else comment on yet. Each wrestler has a different entrance number before her match. Most of these are incredible, and worth watching all by themselves. The best is Becky the cheerleader (the good version of Candy). You can turn these off if you get tired of them.

Bottom line: This game is not simply a gimmick. Beyond the gorgeous women, there is a real wrestling game here loaded with extras. There is a lot of depth to this game that's not readily apparent if you only get it as a rental.",5.0,B0002RQ3H0,FUN is the word,Video Games

"Wario and co. have always shown us what kinds of interesting ways our Nintendo consoles could be used for. In WarioWare Twisted, we saw how cool it was to tilt the Game Boy Advance to shave a guy's beard or guide a ball to a gap. In Touched, we used the stylus to scratch backs, tap buttons, and the mic to blow away Fronks when we weren't supposed to. In Smooth Moves, we used the Wii Remote in all sorts of weird ways (even positioning it by our noses!) and antics like dancing, balancing, shooting, etc. In Game & Wario? We are only given around a dozen demonstrations.

This is because Game & Wario is supposedly a WarioWare ""spin-off"" deviating from the 5-second quirkiness of hundreds of microgames and instead diving into minigames that last minutes. Think each one as a boss microgame in a traditional WarioWare game, except playing each one individually makes for more potential to be fun. You can shoot arrows at baddies, go skiing, take pictures of suspects, and jump from foothold to foothold.

While most of these minigames can be fun in their own right (But not without a few duds), the single player campaign leaves you playing the first level of each one. It doesn't take long before you reach the end of it. During my playthrough, I went ""Wait...That was it?!"" when I saw the credits screen.

That's not to say Game & Wario is a mediocre game. What keeps it from that territory are the games that are truly fun to play when you play them individually, as well as the multiplayer minigames, which never disappoint when it comes to intense hijinks with family and friends! There's even a ""minigame"" that allows you to play through fast-paced microgames just like in the olden days!",4.0,B00CHYOP94,Just enough tasty garlic,Video Games
"I bought a bunch of different ""supposedly"" surround sound headset but none would actually give you a real idea of where the sound comes from except this one.
My only real problem with it is that for that price you'd hope that the quality of the hardware would be better than that. It looks (and probably is) made out of cheap plastic (it's not a big surprise that one of my ear cups broke off after just a year...)
But Tritton makes up for it with an awesome customer support (they are going to replace my broken headset even though I'm 3 months out of the warranty limit ! Way to go Tritton, I wish more hardware makers were like you...)

Pros: real surround sound, compatibility across the board, remote on the wire, awesome support from Tritton (on the phone), two sets of ear-pads, pre-amp that has secondary output for another surround sound system ! (this is so awesome to have)
Cons: sound quality isn't the best but as good as the average headset, quality of the plastic, the mic barely adjust, mic sound quality isn't the best either.

To conclude this headset isn't the perfect headset but for my use of it (online gaming) it's the best I could find out there. (and I love the fact that I don't have to switch between my surround speakers and the headset, I can even listen to both if I want to !)

"I was a little skeptical when I heard that Nintendo was releasing a new system. In fact I was shocked when I saw the E3 presentation that the rumor was true.

The Wii U, when first revealed, had a majority of hate from typical gamers of today. But I liked it. I could already see the potential within this new Console and Controller, the screen acting as a scope for a gun, the map always available but never taking up part of the screen. I was excited.

I waited, read various reports (bad and good) and saved for Nintendos next gen gaming machine.

and Finally the day arrived.

I got the Wii U! I was stoked, I rushed home, plugged the controller in to charge, waited for the light to disappear and started the system.

I was in awe. Of course the next task was the update (which I have grown use to owning a ps3) So I had to wait even longer... but it was worth it.

after setting up my account I quickly popped Nintendo land in and I was in heaven.

Nintendo land Like wii sports basically showed off what the new system is capable of. And my gosh! I was in love, the different ways the controller was used... my mind was blown. Nintendo never seems to fail me in terms of recreating the magic of video games every chance they get. I even rushed out the next day to pick up Zombiu and later in the week downloaded Mario U.

Now I have heard many complain about this system... but I guess nobody realizes that the system ""just"" came out. The ports seem to be poor, but given the fact that the developers didn't have nearly the time they had when developing said ports when they made them for the ps3 360, I'm surprised how good they turned out. And after playing Nintendo land and seeing the true potential this system could have, it makes me look at the ps3 and I can tell it's last gen.

So don't let the constant complainers fool you. This system is amazing. Also, take into account that Nintendo is reaching out to the ""hardcore"" crowd and even created an appstore of there own that is easy to develop for. that's a sign they are even interested in indie developers.

So yeah, Nintendo has just opened the door for all gaming opportunities.

Just try it for yourself, you will not be dissapointed",5.0,B009AGXH64,Nintendo hits a home run (again),Video Games

"Please note that you must have MOVE for this to work, meaning both the MOVE controller and the PS3 camera.

These being said, you get all the fun you can possibly consume out of a 40-song repertoire. Everybody dance features:

- Dance contests, of course, with up to 20 or so contestants dancing two at a time.
- On-screen dancer holding a MOVE, showing you exactly what you are expected to do.
- Preview of the next 3 dance moves as stick cartoons.
- Instant feedback for each of the 2 contestants - anything from 'OK' to 'Awesome'.
- Keeps track of 'streaks' (5, 10, 20... correct moves in a row)
- Scores
- The original video for each song as a picture-in-picture.
- Makes a video of each sessions and it can post it on Facebook and Tweet it.
- Picture taking sessions for the contestants.
- and I'm sure that I missed quite a few more features.

  In this one, Link lives in a forest with the forest folk.  Link is soon inside the Deku Tree to defeat the evil monsters that moved into the tree.  After a battle with the queen spider, the Deku Tree sadly dies and tells Link to find Zelda, the Princess of Hyrule.
  Hyrule is a kingdom that's always in trouble, and its up to Link to save the land from a terrible enemy.  Link has the help of Navi, a fairy that gives you advice or tells you what you should do next.

"The most unfortunate thing about this game is Raiden. Raiden is your typical inexperienced, over commpassionate, teenage hero!!!! He's very much like Luke Skywalker, who receives a lightsaber and suddenly possesses a power which enables him to destroy every vestige of evil in the universe!  Raiden, like many other hollywood heros, is unsuprisingly, a pathetic joke. I'm sure I'm not the only one who's tired of game developers producing young, inexperienced, moronic heros, guided by the belief that gamers will be able to relate to them better. If that was true, then why is MGS 1's hero, 40 year old Solid Snake, the most revered hero in computer game history? Now, I understand that Snake couldn't have been used for this game due to the storyline, but still, I would have preferred someone who was less submissive, who could be perceived as strong, and who wasn't a girl which Radien arguably is! Since Raiden is essentially a pathetic joke, it's hard to believe that he's the hero they make him out to be.

Many people hated the MGS2 storyline, but I think the story could be percieved as fascinating by some or absurdly bizarre by the rest.  I suppose the nearest thing it could be equated to are those conspiracy theories that you find on the web, like massive underground alien bases, LSD experiments, mind control experiments, etc... If you're a fan of that stuff, then you'll probably find the storyline interesting.

Other than Raiden and the storyline, the game is pretty good.  The gamplay, the innovations, the graphics (unexampled still) and the AI can't be faulted, it's just that some might feel that Raiden and the storyline have pulled this game down into the s******. The game's lengh is a problem too. But that's about it! All in all, the game is good, but it's nowhere near as good as MGS 1.",4.0,B00005ML10,The actual game's excellent!,Video Games

"I play video games for their story and here is my top five now that I've finished Nier:

1.  Xenogears
2.  Xenosaga series
3.  Nier
4.  Planescape: Torment
5.  Final Fantasy X

This game is a MASTERPIECE when it comes to the story and never have I seen a game tell its story the way Nier does.  Basically you play through the game, then have the opportunity to play through it again.  And playing through it again is NOT just the same story with a different ending, prepare to have your eyes opened and to be hit in the gut ad you experience it all from a new perspective.  It's very emotional and amazing.

So I made it clear, the story of Nier is original and incredible.  What about everything else?  Well, the soundtrack is one of the best I've heard and the voice acting it out of this world.  Not everything is as amazing though.  The world is kind of small and there is a LOT of back tracking through the same locations over and over.  The side quests can be a terrible grind for little reward, but some of them tell great stories too so it's worth it to push through.  The game isn't perfect, but the story is so good this game MUST be played.

And I will say this final statement:  If you put in the time to play through Nier once and watch the final credits, you are doing yourself the ULTIMATE disservice if you do not do the Newgame+ feature.  Actually you could say you haven't even beaten the game or seen the story unless you have at least played through twice.",5.0,B002BRUTT2,One of the best stories you'll ever experience.,Video Games

"Okay, the first thing you should do is to forget whatever the plot line is in the movie ofwhich this game is based on. Why? The only thing that actually connect the movie to this game is Madame Leota (the fortune teller head in the magic bowl), spiders (lots of spiders), the ghosts, the animated heads, and of course the haunted mansion itself.

You won't be finding Eddie Murphy's character and his family in this game. Instead, you'd be controlling a character named Zeke Hollowayl, a poor lad who was mislead by a vacancy advertisement in the papers looking for a Assistant Caretaker for the mansion. Yes, he has been had.

This game is all about solving puzzles without succumbing to the movie it is base of. In fact, I found it much more entertaining than the movie itself ^_^"" There are friendly ghosts and bad ghosts in this game and you be praying not to run into any of the bad ones, but of course you have to, right?

"Watch Dogs is a game that many people are going to pick up, be that because of the hype, somewhat newish game concept, or the amazing graphics.

First thing is first, Many people have very strong opinions on video games, not just this one. Reviews, comments, and statements about this game so far have been negative and harsh, but don't let that stop you from picking this game up! There are some aspects of this game that may let you down, but it is still a game I consider worth buying. A lot of people reviewing or commenting on this game are focusing on the bad aspects but there are tons of great things about this game!

- Driving-
By far the most complained about portion of this game. Physics are unreal, and driving is less enjoyable than expected. Nothing like our favorite open world game from Rockstar. There are a lot of cars in this game, (65 they say) but you might not want to be spending a ton of time in them. 7/10

-NPCs-
Great and rather realistic, a new bar has been set for conversations and actions of NPCs.
You can listen in on conversations and arguments that these characters have and it is rather believable. 9.5/10 (some physics make this not perfect)

-Graphics-
Looks very good, when it gets dark the city looks awesome. Walking looks smooth, running is a little weird, but nothing to get worked up over. Animations are fluid and for the most part natural. 8/10

-Overall-
Great game, lots of playability, side missions and extras all over. Graphics are good, but not the best we have seen from the ps4 so far. Biggest issue is driving. 9/10

In the end if you like the idea of playing a game where hacking is a big part of it, along with roaming a large city, and picking up plenty of side tasks get this game. There are a ton of negative reviews, but those will come with any game no matter how good.

"About 10 years ago, CoD4 started my affinity for console FPS gaming. It was the reason I bought a 360 and spent countless hours playing with my friends. MW2 then came out and ended up being my series favorite. Its also the game that made me start caring about W/L and K/D stats competitively. I stayed loyal with the series through WaW and Black Ops. I put many hours into Blops, but I did it more as a chore than enjoyment as I felt the series was veering into a same-y direction. I skipped MW3, Blops 2 and Ghosts as they felt unoriginal to me and lacked that special fun feeling present in MW 1 & 2.

After watching many gameplay videos and reading different reviews, I decided to rent Advanced Warfare from Redbox. I played the first few campaign missions and about 6-7 hours worth of multiplayer. I was very impressed and ended up buying it here on Amazon. The campaign seemed interesting enough to get me to complete it soon (which is more than I can say for other CoDs personally), but where I mostly spend my FPS time is in multiplayer like many.

Im very happy with the direction Sledgehammer has taken AW. The Exo Suit adds a lot of combat versatility to the point where 1v1 engagements can have an epic feel with the maneuvering possibilities. Kill streaks don't have the ridiculously discouraging snow ball effect they started having after MW2, and with the Exo Suit verticality, camping seems to be drastically lower in AW. This last one makes me very happy as the increasing camping was a large reason for me leaving CoD originally.

I do have some concerns. Servers can be laggy probably 1 out of every 3 or 4 games on average. However, the game just came out. Remember BF4's launch? I am a major BF fan, and I can tell you AW's launch is smooth as butter compared to BF. There is talk about the lack of dedicated servers being the main issue, but overall the lag was not enough to make me stop playing.

Another concern is how quickly each gun runs out of ammo. It's common for a magazine of 30 to run out in a matter of seconds during full-auto. What this means is that poor aim in an engagement or when an opponent is Exo-maneuvering will likely get you punished hard. Similarly, melee is horrible right now. It only works if you are literally right up on another players face/body. I wouldn't even use melee at all until they patch it. Just stick with hip fire for now.

But my issues are not greater than what I like about AW. The map designs go very well with the Exo Suit and actually remind me of some of MW2's. The game is definitely fast and it is not as easy to score a high K/D consistently, but kills feel very rewarding overall.

Haven't had this much fun with CoD since MW2. Im glad Sledgehammer managed to bring back that arcade fun-ness back with Advanced Warfare. If it's been a few years since you played CoD, I'd recommend giving this a shot or at least renting it from Redbox. If you liked Titanfall, then I would highly encourage you to try out Advanced Warfare.

EDIT:

Advanced Warfare started off great. Once I hit the 15-hour mark, lag & latency issues made themselves present. After hitting 20 hours, I realized they would not be going away. Even after checking in every few weeks, rubber banding, getting killed in one-shot and getting killed after entering corners all were regular occurrences.

"If you've played&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/OBLIVION/dp/B000TG72PG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">OBLIVION</a>, maybe you remember leaving the prison for the first time, being met with this awesome and vast world, and slowly realizing that if you wanted to, right now, you could walk over to that mountain in the distance, search that forest, break into that home, punch that bear, etc. That you were free to do ANYTHING that you wanted to do for as long as you cared to, and no one was even forcing you to keep the main storyline going. JUST CAUSE 2 takes that experience and magnifies it in every way. The world is huge, the visuals are crisp and very beautiful, and the action is as over the top as it can get. I'd be lying if I said the writing and the missions were amazing, but even if you set all of that aside, you'll still have one of the best sandbox games on the market.

Take these comparisons to OBLIVION lightly. JUST CAUSE 2 doesn't even try to have any kind of depth when it comes to the story, the missions, and the sidequests. This is a game for people who like to explore, cause mayhem (chaos), and test boundaries. The people who made it their life's mission to get to the airplane in GTA 3 without unlocking the third island. If you try to dig any deeper than that, you might find yourself disappointed. If you enjoy JC2 for what it is, you'll have yourself a game you can come back to again and again.

Like I said, the story is a flimsy one that would probably be better suited for a '90s Steven Segal flick. You play as Rico Rodriguez, a special agent who's been sent to the (fictional) Southeast Asian island of Panau to track down another agent who has recently gone rogue. To find this rogue agent, you have to gain the trust of the three major gangs on the island. To do this, you have to cause ""chaos"". To cause chaos, you have to, more or less, cause as much damage to the island as you can.

There are several ways to cause ""chaos"". One is to destroy military bases; another is to destroy military-owned structures; another is to blow everything else up: cars, planes, gas stations, broadcast towers, water towers, propaganda trailers, surface-to-air missile sites... the list goes on.

But to get back to the island of Panau - which was the main selling point for me - this place is HUGE, and I do not use the word lightly. To walk from one end to the other will certainly take hours, and even traveling by plane takes at least fifteen minutes. You'll have over 400 square miles to work with, which is 25x larger than OBLIVION, and 5x larger than WORLD OF WARCRAFT, making it one of the largest video game worlds ever created. And it's not just empty space. The developers put a lot of time into making sure that they reward people for exploring every nook and cranny of the game with plenty of easter eggs and vistas that you'll just want to stare at for hours. From lush jungles and beaches to cities and mountaintop villages, there are plenty of unique places to discover on the island.

And just to drive home the ""over-the-topness"" this game allows, you're equipped with a personal grappling hook, and you can do almost anything you can imagine with it. Hook an enemy to the back of your car, tether to an enemy chopper and hijack it in the air, use it to scale mountains or buildings. You're also given a parachute that you can deploy at any time, so if you want to fly as high as you can go, jump out, and land harmlessly: go for it. The game really goes out of its way to make sure that you have a fun time messing around in Panau.

If none of that sounds appealing enough to warrant a purchase, then look elsewhere. Outside the massive world, the dozens of unique vehicles, the spectacular graphics, and the ability to go anywhere and do whatever you want, there's not much else. There's the story, achievements, and a lot of collecting to do, but I definitely wouldn't say they're the game's redeeming features. It's everything else, and there's a lot of it.",5.0,B0013RATNM,Here comes freedom!,Video Games
"This is a really fun wrestling game even if the X-Box 360 controlling takes awhile to get used to. I'm used to the Playstation 2 controlling. Plus I still find Here Comes the Pain the one that's easy to want to go back and play again and again. I mean the season mode is the funnest since you can add legends or created wrestlers to the season mode roster. Then you can play any other match on a card besides the matches for the wrestler you chose.

  I don't think season mode is that fun without that feature. I mean otherwise you just play season mode to unlock the legends and never go back once you got them. While in Here Comes the Pain I kept going back to play season mode even if I did unlock every legend. This game is fun enough to make you go back for more and more even if it's not for season mode. The GM mode is cool where now you can hire writers and pick the one who's best at writing things like David vs Goliath stories and much more. You then pick the two wrestlers that a best to fit in that feud. I also like seeing Title Mode back. Where you can defend or win a title any time you want.

  Plus I love that you can rip-up signs from the audience ""though I haven't learned how to do that yet. You can also fight in the audience this time around which especially adds more to hardcore matches or Last Man Standing matches. The game also has a good roster even if some are pretty bad choices to have in the game. I mean I always forget guys like Vito, Viscera, Snitsky and Paul Burcham are even in the game. Plus do we really need 4 different Mick Foley's ? I mean you'd think they would've learned by now. All they had to do was have one Mick Foley and just give you the option to change his costume before a match to either Cactus Jack, Dude Love or Mankind. It wastes 3 spaces when they could've added other Legends instead.

  Instead of Viscera you could've had someone like Sabu instead, instead of Snitsky how about the Sandman, instead of Paul Burcham ""how ever you spell it"" how about Paul London, Brian Kendrick should've been on it as well. It also feels weird not seeing the Spirit Squard after they've been thrown in our faces constantly on Raw. I also wish Jeff Hardy was on this game. Plus instead of 3 Mick Foley's we could've had Rick Rude, Randy Savage and Owen Hart.

  Some fans complain about Bam Bam Bigelow and Taz being Legends but I like that. I was a fan of Bigelow in his ECW days. All the WWE did with him was have him lose to a football player at a WrestleMania. While in ECW the guy was almost as unstoppable as Taz. The WWE wasted Taz and of course you wouldn't think of him as a Legend  after seeing his WWE Jobber years. However in ECW the guy was an unstoppable animal that is truly worthy of being called a Legend. He was the Stone Cold Steve Austin of ECW. I also like seeing Shane a Legend but if he's one on the game then why isn't Vince ? It feels weird being able to play as Shane but not Vince. Despite minor complaints this is still a really good wrestling game. It is of course still light years better than the first Smackdown vs Raw which I never played as much as Here Comes the Pain.

  Complete list of Legends I'd like to see in the next game: Hogan, Bret Hart, Eddie Guerrero,Owen Hart, Anvil, King Kong Bundy, Earthquake, The Big Bossman, Brian Pillman, The Demolition Axe and Smash, L.O.D Hawk and Animal, Vince, Shane, Razor Ramon, Diesel, Arn Anderson, The Rock, Steve Austin, Mr. Perfect, Vader, if you unlock Mick Foley you get all his personalities in one without him taking up 4 spaces, Chris Jericho, Yokozuna, Rick Rude, Randy Savage, JBL, Jerry Lawyler,Trish Stratus, Lita and the Ultimate Warrior.

  The next game should also have a complete list of ECW wrestlers such as RVD, Sabu, The Big Show, Tommy Dreamer, Kevin Thorn, Test, C.M Punk ""who I wish was in this one!"", Mike Knox and Hardcore Holly.

  I also wouldn't mind that if you play as a certain popular wrestler in season mode that you can unlock legend type matches as well. Like if you play as the Undertaker you unlock a body bag match that he used to have back in the early 90's. Or that when you unlock Stone Cold you unlock 3 Stages of Hell. Plus would be cool if Psycho Sid was on it and if you unlock him you also unlock the Lumberjack match since he had one with HBK once. Also the games should also bring back I Quit matches.",5.0,B000FW8FK0,One of the best wrestling games despite minor complaints,Video Games
"Visuals are excellent, voice acting and storyline are second to none. It's truly fun and addicting. At many times, it felt a bit like GTA 5 except for a few glaring omissions:

- The game is on rails. There are very few if any choices of any kind. You can always tell where you need to go because there are obvious handholds. There is no alternate path, the treasures buy you nothing. You never talk to anyone to obtain clues, etc.

- The reliance on shootouts is too much. The guns are amazing and the shooting mechanics are great. Even the enemy AI is extremely well done. But the antagonist being guns and fighting too much, and puzzles too little, makes it less fun than it should have been.

- The movement mechanics are good at best. Some parts are great such as the climbing and grappling hook. But the jumping, evading enemies, the circle button that means evade, fall, and hide all at the same time depending on where you happen to be standing...makes the already lame shootouts much worse.

I have never played the Uncharted series before but for me the game earns every bit of 4/5 stars, but the 3 issues above need a serious upgrade to live up to the hype of what the game really should have been.",4.0,B00GODZYNA,Solid 4 star game,Video Games

"First, my qualifications:  I'm a 3000 hour real-world instrument flight instructor.  I have been flying PC-based flight sims ever since 1983, when I installed the original ""Microsoft Flight Simulator"" on an Apple IIe with a monochromatic-green monitor.  Since then, I've put in roughly 10,000 hours of ""flying"" on essentially every PC-based flight sim ever made, from Microprose F-19 Stealth fighter all the way up to Falcon 4.0.  For whatever it's worth, folks, I'm an expert on this particular subject.

A few years ago, Shockwave Tri-Synergy came out with the equally magnificent ""Wings of Power,"" that included the coolest airplane ever designed for MSFS 2004, the B-29 Superfortress ""Doc's Deadly Dose.""  I said then that ""Wings of Power"" was worth the $30.00 for that airplane alone.

I am please beyond words to report that, in ""Aircraft Powerpack 2,"" the geniuses at Shockwave Tri-Synergy have utterly outdone themselves yet again.  This time, the star of the show is the absolutely magnificent and totally addictive P-51D Mustang, ""The Flying Undertaker.""  Ladies and Gentlemen, there has simply never been a finer airplane designed for Microsoft FS than this utterly FANTASTIC P-51D.

The other airplanes are all great too.  In fact, they are so good that I feel bad giving so much of the spotlight to the Mustang.  But anyone who is a part of the aviation community will understand.  If there is one airplane in the history of all aircraft that has the biggest aura of ""The Right Stuff"" hanging around it, it is the P-51.  Quite simply, if you were to survey all the serious pilots on earth and ask them what their all-time dream airplane is, I'm guessing that the Mustang would beat out the next closest answer by a huge percentage.

In this nearly perfect simulation software, Shockwave Tri-Synergy has given this legendary airplane all the attention it deserves.  Quite simply, this Mustang and all the other fighters included in this package are so good that they will give you a reason to go out and drop $5000 on the hottest gaming platform made, simply so that you can crank up all the scenery and frame rates to their max and immerse yourself in the ultimate adrenaline-pumping flight sim experience.

Very few of us will ever fly, much less own, a real P-51 Mustang.  For several thousand dollars, you can get an hour in ""Crazy Horse"" down in Sanford, Florida.  For several million dollars plus maintenance and operating costs, you can own your own irreplaceable piece of history and spend your nights awake worrying about some line guy backing his tug tractor into a propeller that would cost over $50,000 to replace.

Most of us pilots have had to content ourselves with watching Jeff Ethell's ""Roaring Glory"" DVD series and flying these airplanes in our dreams.  Now, thanks to Shockwave Tri-Synergy, we get to take our dreams to the next level.

Let's put it this way - nearly everything in the cockpit works.  And I mean nearly EVERYTHING.  Right after you install this and start flying the P-51D, you are going to wind up going online, looking for a copy of the real Mustang Pilot's Operating Handbook.  Plus, this cockpit isn't the battered, half-complete, half-modernized amalgamation that most half-restored P-51s have today.  This is a cockpit that you would find in a brand-new P-51 in 1945, with everything shiny new and all the switches, levers and buttons right where they should be.

No matter how experienced a pilot you are (either real or virtual) you will want to get to know this airplane cautiously.  Give yourself plenty of room - use the big runway at Edwards, or the one at Salina, Kansas.  Spend some time doing traffic patterns, and discover the big pitch change that comes with landing gear operation.  Discover the fact that you can't just pull the power back to idle on the downwind leg abeam the touchdown zone, like you would in a Cessna 172, unless you want to come down like a stone.  Discover the fact that full flaps need to be saved until you are crossing the fence at about 100 - 110 mph.  Discover that the tailwheel is free castoring, and that with the throttle all the way back at idle, you have no rudder effectiveness and have to use differential brakes.  Discover that when you put the nose down at 25,000 feet with the power at 50 inches, you will learn about transsonic control difficulties very quickly.  Discover that, without proper mixture control, you won't be able to climb past about 15,000 feet, and that with it, you can scratch for 40,000 feet if you are determined enough.  Discover that you can blast along a shoreline at over 350 mph at 100 feet, and then pull the nose up, up, up and zoom climb over a mountain, roll inverted and plunge back down to the ocean again.  Discover the ultimate piston-driven adrenaline rush.

And that's just in the P-51.  The Thunderbolt, Spitfire, Zero, Me-109 and Warhawk are all modeled with equal love and care, and I only have a few nits to pick.  For one, why do we get three almost identical Messerschmitts?  The Trop would be enough, couldn't we have had a Corsair, a FW-190 or a P-38 Lightning?  Why do we get the almost pre-historic looking P-47C, with its cage cockpit, when we could have had the far more beautiful bubble-canopy P-47D?  Why do the landing gear sound like little civilian electric motors, instead of like the real systems in the real fighters?

And that's my list of nits - there really isn't anything else to complain about, and there is SO much here to love!

I said this once about ""Doc's Deadly Dose,"" and I'll say it here again about ""The Flying Undertaker.""  To any serious pilot or aviation buff, this software would be worth more than $30.00 for the P-51D alone.  The other airplanes are just a fantastic bonus.

"This is an excellent game. This is one of the few games that has very funny cut scenes and great humor throughout the game. The action is also great, and the special weapons (like the 'land shark' or the 'pocket black-hole') are superb. I enjoyed most of the experience.

Why only 4 stars? Because of the idiotic save-game system! The way you save in this game is by visiting pubs that can be found in the levels (usually one per level). While visiting these pubs is great fun (take the time to listen to the dialog!), they do not work well for their intended purpose. For one, they are to inconsistently positioned. Sometimes, you may play for half an hour, just to find a pub 2 minutes before the end of the level. This causes you to replay very large portions of the game, some of which you literally have to learn by heart and play absolutely perfect (count your bullets!) to make it through.

The other problem with the pub-save-system is that the levels are way too big for a single save point (and the levels with more than one pub are generally the shorter ones for some odd reason). It's just not cool to play for 30 minutes or more without an oportunity to save. You often achieve major objectives with no save point anywhere to be seen.

Also, you will find yourself going back to the pubs just to save the game again. This means that you end up running through previously cleared parts of a level with nothing to do. For minutes at a time! Can you say 'boring'?

If this game had a better save-game system, it would be pure fun and an instant classic. The developers cheat themselves out of a great title with this sort of nonsense. I even considered dropping the game's rating to 3 stars, just because of this issue!",4.0,B0000AI1KC,"Great fun, good humor, but sometimes frustrating",Video Games

"I live in an apartment building and was in the market for a set of headphones that were wired, had a mic and was compatiable with PS3 and PS4.  I purchased these and I've been really fond of them since.

Pros
Sound: Really solid sound output.  The bass really hits and you can almost feel the headphones vibrating every time you squeeze the trigger in a shooter.  In-game dialouge comes through nice and clear as well.
Compatiability: If you're a multi console owner you can't do much better than these. PS3, 360, PS4, PC, iphone etc etc.
Length of cord: Again, wired was important to me because the last pair of wireless headphones I had suffered from the sound cutting in and out, probably because of all the wifi routers in my building.  This cord gives me the consistent and clear sound that I desired, yet I don't have to sit right in front of my tv to enjoy it.
Mic: No need to yell to be heard. I come through crystal clear on these and even when I don't necessarily speak with the intention of being heard by others, the mic still picks me up.
Options: You can simply slide a knob to set the microphone on or off.
Chat control: I love being able to set my mic in headphone volumes (meaning whether I hear myself talkinging in the headphones and the ability to adjust the volume of other players talking.
Build quality: These don't feel filmsy or cheap.  I stepped on them once and they're fine.

Cons
No optical support without using some sort of RCA cable adapter. I currently have the headphones hooked up to my TV as the PS4 is not compatiable with composite or RCA cables.

No way to really lock your sound settings in place.  There is a rectangular device on the wire running from the headphones that allows you to adjust the bass, treble, mic volumes, chat volumes etc but it does so via a sliding nub. This would probably skyrocket the cost of the headphones, but I would really love being able to set my preferred settings and not lose them because the nub is moved by accident.

Other than that, I can't complain.  If you have the means you can probably do better in terms of features and sound quality, but for this price and the amount of systems you can use this with, you're definetely getting a whole lot of bang for your buck. Would have been a five star purchase if it was optical compatiable.",4.0,B018K6KV68,Almost perfect,Video Games

"Taken straight from the arcades and ported into a side scrolling, shiriken tossing, sword slashing, multi-flipping, wall climbing, adrediline pumping 8 bit adventure game.  From the city street slums to the demon's fortress, alot of ninja strategy, 101 percent focus level, and a higher degree of patience is required to triumph, but its worth it.  Another bonus is the amazing cut scenes in between the levels (something thats never seen on any 8 bit console before) of which gets the players even more pumped in playing.  I was warned that the Ninja Gaiden series was more than a challenge and the first of its kind was no exception  I had to endure the annoying back hit so many times (the player jumps back at a great distance when hit by responding enemies, often causing him to fall into a pit) and get use to the wall jumps because the player doesn't always attach on the walls that smoothly.  The obsticles of the levels and the swifter than lightning enemies may be a challenge, but fighting many of the bosses are kind of easy (or at least up until level 4 because I never made it past 5 yet).  I love a challenge as long as its fun and fair (horray for unlimited continues), and Ninja Gaiden is one of them.

"I dearly loved the King of Fighters series in the 1990's. The solid controls, the super combo's, the large team rosters. The plots were complete nonsense and I often wondered if the localization team for SNK ever took an engrish class at the highschool level. Luckily, you never pull at threads when you was schooling suckers at the arcade on these games. No one was more excited about this series than I was but what went wrong?

The Controls! This games controls plays like you fell asleep on your hand and then tried to control your PS2 with a Kinect flailing your numb arms around. Or maybe like somebody inverted your controller and then cut half way through your controller cord with a scissors before you got started. Good luck keeping your nostalgia glasses on while trying to relive your arcade days with these horrific controls.

Additional Warnings- This was not done in HD so anyone with a respectable tv will suffer the consequences. The load screens make you think of starting a side game of Skyrim for something to do while you wait for your retro fighting game to load. This was only marginally faster to load than the Neo Geo CD and that is not a good thing.

The King of Fighters deserved better treatment than this. Hell, SNK deserved better than this but that is a history lesson for another day.

I agree with the other reviewers frustration about the different levels.  If you miss something, you can never go back and make up for it, so you lose any chance of a perfect game.  And you'd want a perfect or near perfect game because you need the awards to use to buy yourself items for the next level.  I actually quit the game twice and restarted in order to get those awards.  The only criticism I'd make is that after learning all the ins and outs, thinking I'm so clever and fully stocked to battle it out at the end?  The last chapter was way, way too easy and I didn't need anything that I purchased.  This game may be a little too hard at times for young ones, but should be ok for 8 and up.

"In the tradition of Caesar, Pharoh and other city-building strategy games, we finally have one set in one of the largest kingdoms the world has seen - China!
Fans of the previous city-building sims will feel right at home here. You start out by building a road, and putting little house lots alongside it. Soon you're placing wells, firehouses, and more advanced structures.
You're learning about Chinese history and culture as you play, wokring with shrines, help shops, mills, and more. You build up your trade and commerce, and fortify your city against attacks. The graphics are great, and you really get involved in the success of your town.
There are even Feng Shui aspects to the game - placing your buildings in auspicious areas of the town help your prosperity!
A fun new addition to the city-strategy series, and a non-violent way to spend countless hours. Recommended!
As a side note, I read the other reviews that said people were having issues. I'm running XP and haven't had any problems at all with the software.",5.0,B00005V9QE,Great fun while you learn about China,Video Games

"I picked this game up for 40$ and I have to say it is money well spent.  Few games these days are good enough to make me feel that my money was put to good use.

While MMXCM is a bit basic as far as exploration and storyline goes, it really shines in the fun department.  The graphics fit the game perfectly and the voice acting, while not the greatest, is adequate.  (Mega Man fans, this time our blue bomber doesn't sound like a little girl!)  Most of the MMX games are hurt by less than stellar voice acting :).

Combat is fun, in that you get weapon energy before each battle.  You can choose to use it, or let it build up for stronger attacks.  Then, you can even use Final Strikes, which means all 3 of your fighting characters jump in at once to deal out major damage.  And each character has a special transform move that makes them twice as tough.  Lots of strategy falls into the battles on this game, especially the boss battles.

There is a sort of mini game that really gets you hooked once you pick up the basics.  During the game, you find Deployment Robots.  You can send these out to stages you have already visited to pick up secret treasures.  They go up levels depending on if you placed them properly and used good strategies.  Very fun.

Speaking of Final Fantasy, I think this game easily blows away FF8, FFX, and FFX-2.

The combat system is fun and doesn't really get old, especially when you get all the characters and are able to switch them in and out of battle at will.  And unlike every other RPG I have ever played, every character is fun and useful to use.  In all the Final Fantasy games, there have been a few characters who I tried to keep swept under the rug at all costs.  Not so in this game.

I would have given the game an overall score of 5 if exploration had been a little better.  Other than that, this is a great game, ESPECIALLY for Mega Man fans.",4.0,B0002A6CPU,Awesome game for RPG fans,Video Games

"I'm writing this with the assumption you know what a Madden game feels like (when running, passing, etc)

Pros:
 Draft Champions is my favorite mode since Franchise. Pick a coach/scheme and 14 good-to-legend status players (14 rounds, 3 players to choose from in each round) then play a series of up to 4 games against the computer or human opponents.
 Great new passing mechanic allows players to control receivers with one button press.
 The Skills Trainer keeps getting better at explaining football Xs and Os.
 The Gauntlet from last year is somewhat bizarre and fun. Look it up and watch a video.
 Player ratings are generally pretty fair.

Cons:
Online connection is TERRIBLE. In the past 7 games I've disconnected from 5. Even when I do connect the response is inconsistent at best. It's not really playable. Certainly not a good way to showcase skill. If you plan to play with friends or compete, this should be a strong consideration. My internet is 100+/mbps and it lags all the time.

"Condemned 2 has a similiar format to the first one, but there is nothing wrong with taking a good game and improving upon it. I had some fun with this title even though the gameplay was repetitive. You have a first person shooter with close combat weapons and a limited number of projectile weapons. Just about everything in the game can be used as a weapon and some items deal more damage vs speed and reach. Combos are not too difficult to pull off with a little well timed practice. Its a brutal game, enemies will be cursing you while you pummel them with a pipe then finish them off by smashing their head into an old TV. Its a dark and somewhat eerie game and the flashlight looks fantastic when shining down those dark corridors. There are alot of those moments where you see a quick flash of someone running around in the dark only to jump out and bust your chin with a 2 by 4, good stuff. There is also an investigation mode that allows you to study a crime scene and figure out the most probable cause of death which i found to be quite enjoyable and i wish there would have been more crimes scenes to investigate. I wasn't really wowed by the storyline, but the close combat gameplay is what this title is about. There isn't too much replay value here, one play through will probably do it for you. It would be a fantastic rental though, but its only 15 bucks so you wouldn't really be out that much cash for a solid game.",4.0,B000XJK40O,Blunt object stress relief therapy 2,Video Games
"A game where I can call down a Titan Machine and squash other players while launching a barrage of bullets, cloaking and wall running onto a friendly titan to shoot more baddies, then jumping off him onto an enemy titan rip a part off of it, then shoot the insides and make the pilot jump out then jumping off and destroy him then back onto it and blow up his titan makes me feel AWESOME. Great game, i rarely get games so early released but def worth it.

The texture settings are barely visible on a small screen under 21 inches so playing on a mid card at high or medium is perfectly fine and doable. The AA settings have multiple options for fxaa low to high and msaa of your choosing as well. Fast paced. No single player campaign here it's all online and multi. play as 2 factions and complete the campaign to get both new titans. OR just jump in and destroy.

Different strategies/weapons for different enemies is refreshing, instead of just blasting away you have to take off their limbs.

"The Thief  series has been around a long time. The first game came out in 1998 I believe and it is an iconic game in the industry and inspired many other stealth games. Each new game in the franchise has had heavy expectations placed on it. The new Thief, like Thief Deadly Shadows before it, has had a  mixed reception. There are those who expect each new game to be exactly like the original. And there are others who want Thief to be more of an action game. Then there are those that have always understood what Thief is about at its core and enjoy it for what it is: a damn good pure stealth series.

The new Thief is no exception. Nothing has given me the sense of skulking about in the shadows and having to use stealth in order to survive better than Thief has. This isn't an action/stealth hybrid like Dishonored or Splinter Cell that you can go in guns blazing and cut down half a dozen guards in a short amount of time. In Thief you have to remain undetected or face the consequences.

At first I was disappointed by the fact you can't use the rope arrow on any wood surface as before and can only attach to specially highlighted beams. But the game makes up for it in other ways. The new swoop ability is pure awesomeness. It gives a fluidity and speed to the game while still feeling stealthy and appropriate.

The graphics are quite good, with some of the best lighting and shadows I have ever seen in a game. The world itself is quite dreary and that may turn off some people, but it has character and a strange dark charm of its own.

The music could be a little more fitting for the setting, in my opinion, but the overall sound design is quite atmospheric. The voice acting is very good in the case of Garrett and fairly good in the case of most of the other characters. Garrett is such an intriguing character.

All in all I think Thief carries the stealth torch admirably, and probably better than any other modern ""stealth"" game. I've enjoyed it a lot and if you like stealth I am sure you will enjoy it too.",5.0,B00BPEBG8A,This is the best stealth game in years.,Video Games

"The hype building up to the launch of this game was pretty enormous. Having missed part 1 and 2 I wasn't really sure what all the fuss was about. Sure, the commercials for GOW 3 looked pretty epic, but could it really live up to all the accolades being thrown its way? Well, I figured I would give it a chance so I lined up at the local game shop at midnight to pick up a copy so I could play it for an hour or two before getting some pre-work sleep. One or two hours soon turned into four and then five hours. I was having a very hard time making myself turn the game off as I was getting deeper and deeper into the story. I kept promising myself that I would stop at the next save point, but then I would think, okay I will just go a bit farther and then turn it off.

Let's start off with the obvious, how does this game look? GOW 3 may possibly be the single greatest looking game ever made! No effort was sparred in bringing the graphics to life. Even the smallest and most distant background items are very detailed. Everything Kratos smashes with his fist or arsenal of weaponry gets covered with blood and gore. I'm not just talking about Mortal Kombat blood for the sake of blood that disappears within a second or two of being splashed into the air. I'm talking about blood patterns that alter the way the baddies and Kratos look as you continue your mission of blood lust. Even the water that Kratos occasionally has to swim and trudge through looks insanely real as it ripples away from his movements. The lighting and shadow effects are as good or better than I've ever seen. For an example of this just check out the Helios boss battle and the cave level that follows.

Next let's look at game play. GOW 3 plays like a dream. The controls are fairly simple making switching to the right weapon for the job and being able to double jump from platform to platform completely up to the skill of the player. I will admit that this game is what a lot of people describe as a ""button masher"". You mash buttons to perform combos, complete sequences, and have an extremely intimate exchange with a goddess...yep that last one really happens. The thing about GOW 3 is that button mashing, while it only gets you so far even on the normal difficulty setting, has never been so enjoyable. The melee combat system alone gives you approximately a dozen different ways to decapitate, disembowel, stomp, or throw your enemies. If that doesn't do it for you, simply grab one of the baddies and run around using them as a battering ram to destroy other baddies. Kratos gets a handful of other weapons and items with most of them having some unique use in different situations. My weapon of choice is the Cestus which brings new meaning to the phrase ""open up a can of whoop @$s"". For an example of just how devastating the Cestus can be check out the Hercules boss battle...I mean WOW, this is some brutally epic stuff!

Finally there's the story...because if this is just random violence wrapped up in a gorgeous package would it still be fun? In this case I think so, but luckily GOW 3 has a completely enthralling story line. Even if you're like me and didn't have the experience of GOW 1 and 2 you can easily jump into this game. You're given a nearly 20 minute history lesson when you first start the game. You will be up to speed and obliterating a multitude of enemies in no time. Kratos himself is an undeniably interesting character. He is completely brash and uncaring about all the death and destruction unfolding around him due to his own actions. He is blindly driven by his rage and need for revenge which leads to intense and at moments humorous dialogue. The voice acting and mannerisms displayed by all characters could not be more spot on! I can't stress enough how epic the sheer scale and weight of this story is. Smashing your way through waves of baddies and completing puzzles to face off against one of the many truly impressive bosses hasn't been this satisfying since the days of the Nintendo Entertainment System! With GOW 3 clocking in at slightly over 10 hours it's a very satisfying experience whether it's your first or even fifth time playing through. And yes, this game is that deep and visually stunning that 3-5 play-throughs will feel like a breeze.

It's time to wrap this thing up! I realize I'm way late to the party when it comes to putting out my thoughts on GOW 3, but it's something I've been meaning to do for quite a long time now. If you have not picked up this game by now then you're looking at some really good timing because you can get it from around $15 used to $25 new. GOW 3 has earned its place among a very select few games ever released that can legitimately be regarded as ""best ever"".

"I'm not exactly sure what it is about the game that makes me love it, but I'll list a few elements:

1) Nostalgic JRPG/Anime-Feel: This is not going to apply to most folks, but for me there was a feeling in the art, voice acting, and story that just gave a good sense of nostalgia.

2) Graphics: The game is beautiful, it is very difficult to dispute that.  Unless you have an unreasonable hatred for the Anime/Manga style of art, you will probably think the same.

3) Addicting Gameplay: The factors are there.  Getting experience, leveling up, unlocking new Orders and equipment for my squad--I just kept wanting to grind to get my troops to the next level.

4) What-happens-next-syndrome: The game was addicting for more than just leveling up.  I just always wanted to see what the next chapter had in store for Squad 7.

Those are the four biggest factors in my opinion.  The music and other factors are decent, to say the least.

"My review is based on the single player campaign on the PS4. The multiplayer component of the game is probably perfect.

Pros:
+Visual appearance of players, guns, environments, robots and vehicles is highly detailed and very realistic.
+The game is very fast-paced and always plays very fluidly and has no stuttering.
+The concepts of the environments strongly reminds one of Inception.
+The robots enemies were a blast to play against and they looked very detailed and convincing.

Cons:
-The user interface for Gun Smithing and Loadout Editing is very tedious to use. I ended up using just the Loadout Editor although I wanted to use gunsmithing.
-It's very unclear that the Fabrication Points are pooled between weapon customization and cybercore customization.
-The safehouse was very detailed and reminded me of Commander Shepard's room in Mass Effect. But you couldn't interact with the NPCs and there wasn't much to interact with.
-I really did not get or like the story.
-I didn't have a favorite NPC like ""Soap"" in the previous games.
-Some enemies like the ""mother gunship"" behaved like arcade bosses in that their actions were repetitive/predictable.",3.0,B00VU4J13W,Review of the single player campaign game,Video Games

"Short Review:

Dead Space 2 is great at certain points, and it's fascinating to learn more about Unitology, but the ""More, more more"" philosophy eventually makes the player numb to the horror elements, and the rest of the game doesn't do much to stand out.

Long Review:

As a rule, I always rent games before buying them, as I prefer to spend only a few bucks on a video game, rather then pay full price and find out I don't like it.  However, being a huge fan of the first Dead Space game, I made an exception and purchased Dead Space 2 on it's first day of release, looking forward to another trip into the world of Unitology, necromorphs, and outright insanity.  Sadly, it was a purchase I really regret.

Dead Space 2 follows Isaac Clarke, the unluckiest engineer in the Milky Way Galaxy, as he wakes up on a space station a few years after the events of Dead Space 1.  Not knowing how he got there, he quickly finds himself thrust into yet another necromorph outbreak, and a desperate race for survival, while having to battle a far more personal foe that may threaten his very sanity.

The first Dead Space was an outstanding experience in sci-fi horror.  You were trapped aboard an empty space ship millions of miles from rescue; ammo was scarce, and you had to use everything in your disposal to survive.  Naturally, the sequel would want to further build upon that foundation by giving the player more of what they wanted...more monsters, more guns, bigger environments, and more action.  However, the, ""More, more, more"" attitude completely backfired in almost every aspect, giving us a very disappointing shooter that somehow manages to make a misstep on almost everything that made the first game a masterpiece.

To begin with, the story of Dead Space 2 doesn't really feel important...there's a necromorph outbreak, and you have to stop it, so off you go on another quest to destroy another marker.  By the end, it doesn't feel like you've accomplished much, and it all feels somewhat weightless, with little dramatic weight.  Isaac's dementia, a huge selling point in advertisements and on the back of the game box itself, is not used to it's full potential, instead being used for a few hallucinations and seeing his dead girlfriend.  Isaac never seems crazy or suffering from his dementia, and it's a sadly underused idea that I would have liked to see expanded.

The characters don't fare well either:  Isaac now talks, and aside from sounding much younger then he really is (he's 43, but sounds like he's in his late 20's), he's still an errand boy, only now more people tell him to do things instead of just one or two.  Romantic lead Ellie comes across as a generic action girl, and doesn't leave an impression.  The main bad guy, Tideman, is so non-threatening that I wanted to give him a lollipop, pat him on the head, and assure him that he was a very good sport for at least trying (and it gets downright amusing how often he says something along the lines of, ""It all ends here Clarke!"").  The character with the most depth, ironically, is fellow mental patient Stross: he has the most fascinating story of any Dead Space character to date, and it was a delight to see what he would do next as the game went along.

To it's credit, I do like how Dead Space 2 delves deeper into Unitology, the not-Scientology-religion that's taken over earth in the Dead Space universe.  It's fascinating to learn about their beliefs and how they operate (""Give unto the church and the church will give unto you""), especially considering how most of the unfortunate residents of Titan station have miniature markers and shrines in their possession, along with taking up mass ritual suicide.

But while the Unitology element of the game is impressive, the story and characters are still weak; that alone won't break a game, but perhaps the biggest flaw of Dead Space 2 is it's policy of, ""More, more, more.""  So many horror elements are thrown at you throughout the game that you quickly become desensitized to it, and as a result, I found that the game just wasn't scary.  It's the type of horror where you're walking down an empty corridor only for a monster to suddenly leap out a vent and practically scream, ""LOOKATMEIMAMONSTAHRAHRAHRAHBOOGABOOGABOOGA!""  It's startling the first time, but quickly becomes VERY predictable.  In fact, there's only one area in the entire game where you walk around for an extended period of time without being attacked, but it doesn't last long before the monsters are leaping at you again and screaming at the top of their lungs.

Speaking of monsters, there are several new foes you have to face, along with almost all the baddies from the first game; the problem is that all of them are excruciatingly annoying, such as the puker, who's lovely vomit attack is annoyingly accurate; the leapers, ware are even faster and stronger then before; the damn stalkers, who will make you want to take a ripper blade to whoever designed them, and the pack, which consists of zombified children, who are fast, annoying, and DO NOT STOP SHRIEKING.  You're constantly swarmed by multiple types of necromorphs all at once, and they only get stronger as the game goes on, increasing the frustration level triplefold.  There's a multi-level battle in a red room, for example, that made me want to quit the game, simply on how many enemies I faced, and how many times I kept dying.

But what's most disappointing about Dead Space 2 is the lack of ""Wow!"" moments.  The first game had incredible boss battles, but shockingly, there's only one boss fight at the very end of the game.  You do fight a few mini-boss necromorphs throughout the game, but they are, frankly, forgettable.  There's also a crushing lack of amazing moments that stick with you once the game ends; the first game had several, from a trench run in the void of space to the final, titanic boss battle.  There are only a few such moments here:  A train ride, an astonishingly awesome free flight through space (the zero gravity segments, by the way, are MUCH improved, and a sheer joy to play), and a moment involving a rather large needle(which is the most terrifying moment in the series to date).  While these are the moments where Dead Space 2 is at it's best, it's so frustrating because once they're over, you won't see anything that comes even close to being as cool.

In keeping with not really standing out, the levels of Dead Space 2 don't leave much of an impression.  To their credit, the developers do try to have variety:  Instead of going through numerous industrial environments like last time, you go through apartments, malls, schools, military bases, etc.  The problem is that most of these areas are bright, clean, shiny, and well lit, which isn't scary at all.  A mine stage, for example, instead of being dark and creepy, is filled with brightly colored lights, to the point where it started to feel like the inside of a christmas tree; there's even a stage where everything is brightly lit with blue light, and it honestly wouldn't be too much of a stretch to see neon signs and disco balls hanging about.  You'll also notice that a lot of these environments start repeating themselves, as you'll go through the same hallways, plazas, and walkways again and again, and it reaches ludicrous levels about halfway through the game, where the amount of copying and pasting becomes absurd, and it feels like the developers were trying to pad the game out to make it longer.  However, to be fair, the entire last stage of the game does manage to become visually amazing, and stands out as the most exciting stage of the series so far, and is easily the most pulse-pounding and dramatic part of the entire game.

One final nitpick:  Isaac's dead girlfriend, rather then being a terrifying specter of horror and loss, instead spends so much time yapping away and shrieking about how guilty Isaac supposedly feels, that I wanted to slap duct tape across her mouth to make her shut up.

Overall, Dead Space 2, is, in my opinion, an example of how too much can really be too much.  Take the classic film, ""Aliens"" for example; it had a bigger location then the first film, more aliens, marines, guns, and explosions.  But the high paced action moments were spread out throughout the film, and didn't come nonstop, one after another.  If Dead Space 2 cut out about half the combat sequences and just slowed down, I would give it a much higher score.  But as it is, I feel it's a noble attempt to be a great sequel, but it stumbles badly.  There's a great game here; it's just too fast paced, too full of monsters, and tries to pack in too much for it's own good.",2.0,B00309XHD0,"A shuffling, shrieking mess",Video Games

"When I was a kid obsessing over my NES console, I never really had any desire to own a Genesis.  That is, until I saw pictures of Ecco the Dolphin.  This game simply had what I loved at the time- an underwater dolphin adventure.  I loved thinking about floating around underwater and loved dolphins since hey, they're beautiful fish right?  The game surely doesn't disappoint in terms of speed.  This game is REALLY fast!  Unfortunately the game seems to focus on speed above all else.  It's not as charming as it once was.  The concept was innovative at the time, but nowadays some of us chuckle at the idea of controlling a dolphin going on an adventure.  The game seems to have an element of history to it, meaning you get to hear stories of the Atlantis and even swim to those particular areas.  The problem venturing into new areas is that the game takes place underwater the entire time and your surroundings are never much different from the other places, so everything tends to blend together.

Ecco the Dolphin is one rock hard game too.  It's hard in that it's almost impossible to know where you're going without some online help, and as some of you may remember, back in the day we didn't have the assistance of online help so most of us just put the game away and saved it for a rainy day whenever the frustration level kicked up too high.  There's some carefully hidden places where you have to swim through rocks just to find new important locations, and it's really aggravating and time-consuming to place those particular areas in such a place most of us would NEVER think about looking.  Perhaps a guide detailing each area would help tremendously, but as far as I know no such map exists.

Another problem is that there's only a few varieties of enemies.  You will see the same jellyfish, sharks, crabs and squids over and over.  Ecco can take them out using a sonar move, or a charge move which is neat.  You'll also see several diamonds and rings that Ecco can push to open up new areas which is a pretty cool original feature.  I honestly think the game was designed all wrong however.  Instead of making it open world (or rather open waters) the game makers should have ditched that concept entirely and just focused on shorter straight forward levels where the object is to avoid and survive sea creatures until you arrive to the boss fight (and this game has a SEVERE shortage of boss fights).  I say this because the exploration can get monotonous after a while due to the game lacking entertainment and replay value.  Ditch the exploring aspect, and especially ditch the history lessons and storytelling since we're playing a game here.

But the good news is that the music is really tremendous.  An experimental rock band like Tangerine Dream would be proud to hear all these moody, ambient and very detailed and original songs (original by Genesis standards I mean).  Really incredible job overall on the music which does provide a feeling of underwater loneliness and desperation.  Usually I have negative things to say about the cold metallic music normally found on the Genesis, but not this time.

Overall well the high speed of our little Ecco friend is quite immaculate, the graphics are downright fantastic, Ecco's animations are really smooth and for some people the exploration may feel satisfying enough for some but to me the game's a little disappointing in that regard.  If we consider the lack of genres that focused on underwater exploring back in the early 90's however and recognize Ecco for being one of the first to have such a quest, well, that's pretty cool then.  But the game feels like it needs more to truly win me over.",3.0,B000B9SIJU,ecco or echo?,Video Games

"XIII was well styled and was fabulous on this game.  The look of it was new and exciting.
I had very high hopes for this game.  I gave it 4 stars but really I should have given it 2.  The rating shouldn't suffer because I did though so I went ahead with the 4.
The people who loved this game I apologize to you right now.  I'm not a gaming genius.  I love games don't get me wrong and the look and sound of this one had me hooked.  It was a great idea.
Now for those who want to know what I didn't like there is a list and it's got several items on it.
I played the Gamecube version of this game and maybe that's why I had so much trouble out of it I don't know.
1st my guy was way too easy to kill.  I couldn't get used to the game because before I knew it I was dead.  I know big time gamers are blaming me and part of it is me.
However, this game didn't have a mode that I could find that once I saved at a certain place I could ever end up where I was when I saved.  If you die you start the level over from the beginning.  If you are a great gamer with lots of patience that's fine.
If you are like me and want to throw the Gamecube through the TV it's a different story(And don't do that I am not responsible I didn't make the game).
I really liked the game itself it had good ideas to it and I wanted to see the storyline carried out.
However when you are sitting on pins and needles because you might get killed and have to start over is a pain.
It would take me forever to get past a level and I only got to the place where you are out in the snow.
I'm sure it's because I'm not a good first person shooter player, but part of it is the game.  There is absolutely no room for error with this game.  Your checkpoints as they call them are your only real save point that you have so you don't have to start from the very beginning of the game.
I don't want to have to stealth around though and kill guys only to have one jump out and kill me right off.  The controls move smoothly but I didn't like the fact that if I am lucky enough to shoot one guy my gun perspective changes and next thing I know someone could be in front of me before I can get focused again.
I found this game frustrating at best.  When I did get the hang of it somewhat I got stalled in the woods in the snow and by the time I got the power turned on the guards would sneak out and kill me.
They could have made this game so much better by adding a dummy feature for people like me.  And when you hit save you were actually accomplishing something by using the save feature. The game usually saves your checkpoint so that's not a problem but into the level if you get any distance you better hold on because if you mess up your back to the beginning of that level.  That's  alot of protection to look for when you have guys coming from all angles.
The auto aim feature was awkward at best.
This game is well intentioned, but I only wish the creators of these game would also remember some of us enjoy games, but aren't excellent players. I understand programming these things isn't simple, so throw in a cheat code or something so I can enjoy the gaming experience without thinking badly about what would otherwise be a fun game if I didn't die every 5 seconds.",4.0,B000093NQI,This game????,Video Games
"Neither of my children have a DSi - not for lack of begging, however - but they both have a DS Lite. So I got this pouch for my son and the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/DSi-Protection-Kit-Princess-Peach-Version/dp/B0043QWYL0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">DSi Protection Kit - Princess Peach Version</a>.

Firstly, make sure you realize that while this is labeled for the DSi, it fits the DS Lite perfectly. My son was easily able to fit his DS Lite into the pouch and was also able to put six games in the pouch as well. There's also an extra pocket where you could potentially put more games as well, but he opted not to. He did, however, absolutely love the little spot for the stylus, allowing him to keep the stylus in the pouch or to have a second stylus ready to go - ya know, in case he accidentally drops the other one in the car and we can't find it...because of course that would never happen. Ahem, anyway, while he loved the design, I absolutely loved the hardness of the case. The back and the front have an extra amount of protection to them, so that if he just happens to drop the case - because of COURSE that will never happen (read the sarcasm there), it will have a bit of protection. He has a larger case, but this is the perfect size to travel in the car or on a field trip, and the fact that it has all the Mario characters on it (although my son pointed out that poor Donkey Kong never gets any respect and is not on the case) is just an added bonus!",5.0,B0043QTG0M,Perfect Small Carrying Case for DS Lite,Video Games
"I've got kids, and this headset makes for a nice solution where I can game at night without waking them up (without having to play with no sound at all) and without having to run a wired headset from my stereo receiver.

First things first:  the sound quality is great.  Wasn't sure how well this headset would capture the ""surround sound"" feel that helps to immerse you and add to the atmosphere, and I was impressed by how well it pulled that off.  My wife is a bit of an audiophile (and a Ratchet & Clank fan) - and the first time she put these on her exact response was, ""Holy @#!^, this sounds fantastic!"".

I bought this on a pre-release preorder deal for $60 and it is worth every penny of that.  Not sure that I'd pay the full $100 asking price (for the $40 difference, I might just run a wired headset through my stereo).

Additional bonus:  This also works flawlessly on a PC

"Deepak Chopra has done a fantastic job of making meditation accessible and fun!  The first night I got it, I used it for the first three guided meditations, customized my happy colorful mandala, and used the play option some.  Then about an hour or two later, I felt a wonderful sense of what I would call positively energized peace and well-being.  I had been feeling kind of run down, anxious and somewhat depressed because of school, work, a stressful work environment, and of course holiday stress.  I have had virtually no energy, but at the same time felt sort of overly anxious so that I couldn't sleep well and my mind was laden with worries, worries, worries.  I knew beforehand that meditation had worked very well for me in these kinds of situations.  However, I had gotten off track because of a momentarily overly busy lifestyle and then this led to just getting totally derailed.  I heard about Leela from the tiny buddha website and picked up a copy at Gamestop.  I LOVE IT!!!

One thing I really like about it is that you have so many options of HOW to meditate.  You can choose to do guided meditation with the silky voice of Deepak Chopra guiding you or you can do silent meditation.  And within each of these categories you have various meditations to choose from or you can do them all as many times as you want.  If you want to focus on a particular meditation or a particular chakra, you have that option.

And what I really really like is that even if you are too tired or worn out to do these kinds of meditation, you can always do the play version which is absolutely wonderful!  In the past, the number one reason I have stopped meditating is because I've been too physically and/or mentally exhausted to even sit and meditate. Soon thereafter, I end up getting off track with my meditation practice and then it's simply not a part of my routine at all.  Inevitably, I end up getting so run down that I have to bring everything to a screeching halt and re-vamp my schedule/routine/etc. in order to fit meditation back into my schedule somehow because it works so much better than anything else I've tried (and I've tried all kinds of stuff!)  I have a very emotionally taxing job so it is critical that I regularly practice self-care; otherwise, I will not be able to give the quality of service my clients need and deserve.  This is but one important reason why this program is so great.  You have so many levels of meditation and choices at each level.

In addition, all the meditations have a beautifully colorful and abstractly organic scene to watch if you'd like.  There are also soothing sounds so if the visual focus doesn't work for you, just listen to the music.

I have read some good books on meditation such as ""8 Minute Meditation"" as well as many others.  I also have many DVD's of Qi Gong, Tai Chi, Yoga, etc., etc., and they are all wonderful.  I've also had personal training in many of these areas as well as martial arts and several forms of dance.  However, for someone who is serious about meditation and who has experienced the truly deep and expansive rewards of a good meditation practice, this is a very nice resource to have on hand.  Variety is the spice of life, they say, and it is this variety that will help keep you on track.  This has helped me keep on track, even though we all fall short of our own expectations sometimes.  After all, we are perfectly imperfect and that's just perfect, right?  ;-)  Leela is a great resource for beginners as well because it is just flat out the sweetest eye and ear candy I've seen and heard for meditation.  In actuality, it is the composite of all the features of Leela that make it so awesome.  The price is no more expensive than other Wii games so if want this kind of program for a game system, be ready to pay game system prices.  Plus, you have more flexibility on a game system than you would have on a DVD.  To me personally, it's well worth the regular game system price that it retails for.  I'd rather pay $40 for Leela that will benefit me physically, mentally and spiritually on a more steady basis than pay $10 on DVD's that I'll get tired of in no time, OR $40 or more a week for personal training.  I'd go with Leela any day.  :-)

I'm so glad that Deepak Chopra has created such a fun and user friendly meditation program.  This program fills a very needed void and I really hope that it will be the spark that turns more people on to the mental, physical and spiritual health benefits of meditation which have been substantiated by peer-reviewed research by very reliable sources.  I encourage you to investigate this for yourself.  You don't have to take my word for it.  The proof is waiting to be found.

What I'm now looking forward to is seeing this program/app/game on the iPhone and the Nintendo DS/3DS.  ;-)

- It's wired. This one isn't really a con, it's more of a matter of preference for me. Some people like wired over wireless, but other (such as myself) prefer the wireless controllers.
- It feels cheap. This controller has a sort of cheap vibe to it, almost like it's going to break at any given moment.
- No Six Axis technology. This is unfortunate as some of the games I really like to play require this feature.
- A lot of reports of the controller breaking less than 6 months into its use. This didn't happen to me but it seems to be a problem for some.

"I tried to give this game a chance.  I truly did.  I would typically play it for about a half an hour at a time because I kept turning it off in frustration.  The controls are not fluid, objectives are blurry and the graphics are sub par for a next gen console (I played it on the PS3).  The original Splinter Cell, Pandora Tomorrow and Conviction are all great games.  This installment sucks major balls.

UPDATE - Ok, so I'm the type of reviewer that will definitely admit to making a bad call on any review I publish.  My initial review of this game was a bad call.  Yes, initially I did continuously turn it off in frustration.  However, I kept hearing about how good the game was, so I decided to sit down and work through my frustrations and really try to get into the game.  Well, that was a great idea.  It took some patience, that's for sure.  But once I got over a few initial frustrating points and actually got into the game, I couldn't put it down.  It really ended up being a great game.  I played through it all the way to the end (which took quite a while) and I must say, it is now one of my favorite games.  Just goes to show that sometimes you just have to be a little patient when a game has promise but starts out a little more difficult than you're used to.  Now, I stand by my comments about the graphics - they could be better.  However, once I got used to the control scheme, it worked great.  I'm a huge fan of this series, with Conviction being my favorite.  Double Agent is now my second favorite.  A must own...if you're a patient gamer.

PROS
 - Great story line
 - Superb voice acting
 - Controls are good
 - So fun that the replay value is high

CONS
 - The graphics for the PS3, while not atrotious, could be better
 - Some missions have relatively vague direction and can be frustrating

Bottom line: a fantastic game that you should own.",4.0,B000CBVC0Y,This Game Sucks Balls - If You're Impatient!,Video Games
"Words cannot describe and intricate and innovative Sly Cooper and the Theivius Racconus is. Released in the last quarter of 2002(a great year for games) Sly brought a lot of freshness to the once stale platforming genre.

"Miyamoto, although your games are great, don't baby us Americans. This game was a very easy and, sadly a very short play. I was half tempted to pay the extra money to make my GameCube Japan compatable just to play a harder game. I was appauled to find that he had reduced the difficulty of the game to suit American needs. He must have thought that Americans would have thought the games new graphic style to be, well, kiddy. Our economy would say no to that. If anything, you should keep it the same. America has the has the largest economy for games, man! Bigger than Japan! Give us some bang for our bucks. Come on Miyamoto. Zelda has left us enthralled for years, and we can take a change. I loved it! I would have preferred to see the Zelda promised by E3, but I have to say the satisfying puff of a Moblin being whooped is a great sight.
Sound: 4.5/5. Great music, but it would have been better if the Sun Song was unadulterated from Ocarina of Time. Other than that, the music was flawless.
Controls: 4/5. This game's set-up was the same as Ocarina's, but it was hard getting used to the C-stick not being used as an item quick-play button, if you played Ocarina on the GC
Gameplay: 4/5. Good on land, but when you first get out at sea for the beginning of the game, it feels like slave labor moving the boat for 10-25 minute intervals. This added much of the time I spent on the game.
Graphics: 5/5. Freaking gorgeous. Eye-candy for the tasteful gamer.
Difficulty: 2/5. This game was easy up until Ganon's Tower, where it got too hard, too quickly, starting with fighting all of the games bosses AND fighting Puppet Ganon, Phantom Ganon, Ganon and Ganon a second time.

"I remember the first time I played SFII...it was and still is one of the greatest fighters out there.  My brother and I would play it for hours.  I generally enjoyed the later releases but nothing touched SFII.

With that said, I was skeptical when I first saw Street Fighter IV.  Granted, it looked great but I wasn't too confident that it would ""feel"" like the old days.  Despite my reservations I bought SFIV yesterday and was blown away.  It feels so much like Street Fighter II, yet has been improved upon with not only the graphics but fighting system and moves as well.  The new additions offer a more dynamic fighter experience.  It's great to use the same old moves that are familiar but it's hard to beat landing a well-timed ultra combo.  The online play is the other great feature.  Arcade mode is fun and all, but the real joy is testing your skill with other players.

Whether you are an old school SF fan or just getting into it, definitely buy Street Fighter IV...it's well worth it.

P.S.  ...watch out for some sore thumbs.",5.0,B0012N5MIO,SFIV delivers,Video Games
"Having thoroughly enjoyed Toursist Trophy, I looked for something with a bit more structure and have been very satisfied with MotoGP 4. The focus of this game is MotoGP racing and includes all the bikes, riders, teams and tracks from the 2004 season in all three classes (125cc, 250cc, and MotoGP).  The three classes of racing are quite distinctly different in feeling and racing style, and each bike is different from the others in the same class, as well.

The heart of the game is the Season mode, where you can join the MotoGP circuit as a rookie on any of the various teams in the 125cc class. The better the team you choose, the better the result they expect from you. There are 16 races in the season and each race has a basic routine. First you engage in Free Practice, which allows you to learn the track and adjust your bike's settings for best performance on that particular track. Part of this will be due to your riding style and once you find something that works, it won't need much adjustment for other tracks, except to adjust top speed vs acceleration. Some tracks such as Mugello, will need higher speeds, while tracks with shorter straights will be better with lower top speeds and higher acceleration.

After you're comfortable with the track and your settings, you will run through Qualifying Practice. This gives you three laps to get the best possible time and will determine your position at the start of the race. Finally, you will do the actual race itself. The season can be set up to have races of 2 laps, 5 laps or full (about 21-28 laps, depending on the length of the track and the class you're racing). Regardless of length, you get a full grid of opponents to race against (18+ for MotoGP, more for the smaller classes).

During the season you will get the opportunity to test new parts for your bike, such as a new engine, better brakes, new fairing, etc. To get these you must complete a very difficult challenge, such as getting your bike above a certain speed by the time it crosses a line, or stopping within a coned area after racing down a long straight, but without any preparation.

Depending on your results in your first season, you may get offered a chance to ride in the 250cc class, again picking the team you want to ride for. Finally, after 2 seasons you may get a chance to enter the premier class - MotoGP.

In addition to Season play, there is an Arcade mode for one-off racing and both online and local multiplayer modes. The Time Trial mode allows you to use a ghost replay and also shows the racing line of the ghost image, allowing you to visually see what you did the previous time through, no matter where the ghost image may actually be.

A Challenge Mode includes 125 different Challenges. Completing a Challenge awards MotoGP Points and unlocks things you can ""buy"" with those points. The Challenges range from winning a championship in season mode to specific one-off riding trials and can be very difficult. The various trials include racing a section of track within a specific time, following a difficult pylon course on various tracks, and a ""survival"" mode where you run a continuous race of 1 lap each against increasingly good opposition riders and bikes.

The MotoGP points allow you to purchase various things from the store. These are generally unlocked and made available for purchase by completing Challenges. You can ""purchase"" new tracks (such as Suzuka '02), all the riders in each class for play in Arcade mode, and various videos and still images from both the game and real MotoGP. You can also unlock a Legends racing class, but I have yet to do that and can only imagine it goes back to the 500cc 2-stroke era.

One particularly enjoyable aspect of the game is getting to race against some of the sport's stars, especially facing the current ""young guns"" like Dani Pedrosa, Randy de Puniet, and Casey Stoner, while they were still in the 250cc class.

As for the graphics, I don't know what others are complaining about. There is plenty of detail, especially where it is needed in the track and the braking identifiers. There is less flash than in Tourist Trophy, but you get to race against a full grid of opponents on a wide range of bikes, instead of against just 2-5 opponents, sometimes all on the same model, as in TT.

Also unlike TT, there is a range of difficulty levels and the ability to race in wet conditions. You can choose between Easy, Normal and Hard for the opponent ability in races. This directly affects how fast they can go on each track. Next, you can turn on or off Sim mode and, if not in Sim mode, can turn on Automatic Braking, which means all you have to do is hold down the gas and steer, which is great for younger children. You can set the weather conditions of indivudal races in Arcade mode and can choose to race the season in all Dry, all Wet, or Randomly selected weather. Racing in the rain is a particular challenge in that you lose all your normal braking markers and must really know the track to be successful.

Highly recommended for any Racing Game fan, and especially to fans of motorcycle racing. This game is so good, I bought MotoGP 2 and MotoGP 3 used from 3rd party sellers to get a feel for the earlier seasons, including the transition year between 500cc and 990cc eras.

"This won't be a long review. I'll just say this is one of the best games of Playstation 2 I have ever played and the most underrated video game I've ever known. This is a 3D beat-em-up that avoids being repetitive by being difficult. You customize your own moveset and way you play, and mastering the game becomes nearly impossible by the balance system in place.

The better you play, the harder it gets in-game, going up 4 difficulity levels as you play. On Die, the hardest level, enemies can kill you in a couple hits. But you can always Beg For Mercy to make the game easier again. Playing it on its hardest not only gets you more rewards but tests your own limits and skill as well, which is where the true fun of the game comes from.

Other than your standard moves, you also get super moves, which are chosen by your roulette wheel. And you get the God Hand itself, which allows you temporary invincibility, strength, and speed. The game is hard enough though, where you'll need to save all of these for the hardest challenges or near-death moments. Even the best players will always have difficulty in this game. There's even an achievement (kind of) for playing through the game without using your God Hand and Roulette wheel. (A ""Kick-Me"" sign gets put on your back early in the game that goes away when you use the God Hand or Roulette, and the game challenges you to make it to the end with this sign still attached on you; which is nearly impossible!)

The game is just the right length, lasting about 8 hours or so, so it avoids getting stale, and by the time you get to near end, you'll be tired and exhausted (especially if you played all the way from the beginning in one sitting) but will still have enough energy to keep going and push through to the final fight.

The game also has an awesome sense of humor, cool characters, and great music, too. It's only downside, subjectively, would be the graphics. Or possibly, no multiplayer. That, and the fact that a sequel was never made. :(

God Hand is simply a cult classic and one of the best games you've probably never played. It's fun, difficult but fair, and just awesome, personified. Gene IS the God Hand. This is a must-play for any action game lover. I don't know who Clover Studios ticked off, because all the critics hated this, but ALL of them are dead wrong.

"I have been a really big fan of Rock Band since the beginning. This one does improve on the past ones and doesn't try and stray far and make it into something it isn't by changing it a lot. The graphics are noticeably better and the gameplay is pretty smooth. The premise is pretty much the same. Start a band and play shows to become successful and unlock customization. One difference in it is that you can choose to do shows that give you more fans but less money and vice versa.

The guitar was not as great as MadCatz tried to make it seem it was going to be but it is definitely better feeling than the older ones (side note:I was sent a defective guitar that would strum down multiple times after a few strokes). I wasn't able to use my Singstar mics which is a downer but my old guitar and usb mic worked great.

The voting system is interesting and the freestyle solos I'll admit I am still getting used to because I am still not entirely sure how to properly do it. So far I'm not really a fan of them though

It does not have online but I can't say I miss that because it is more of a party game. I didn't even use it in Rock Band 2

For me the calibration worked fantastically. In the previous games no matter how many times I did it I could not get it to feel completely right.

"Alpha Protocol for the PC

I purchased Alpha Protocol for the PC only because it was less expensive than Xbox 360, however I later found out that it is very easy to earn a bunch of achievements in 1 playthrough, so in retrospect I should have purchased Alpha Protocol for my Xbox. Nonetheless, I found the game to be enjoyable. It is a 3rd person shooter/RPG similar to Mass Effect. There are mini-games to crack safes, hack computers, and bypass doors.

The inventory system is very easy to use, although it suffers many of the same problems as Mass Effect 1 where there are a bunch of different weapons in each family and you don't really know if they're good or not without quickly glancing at the specs. Many of these weapons are given fake names to avoid licensing issues with the real manufacturers. I saw the Remington/Bushmaster ACR, AK, FN SCAR among the assault rifles, and a few pistols. The weapon mods are plentiful and you can apply 4 different categories of mods.

The same goes for the battle armor, and you can carry up to 8 different gadgets depending on the capacity of the armor.

There are quite a few bugs and quirks in the PC game. When switching weapons, the zoom doesn't always work the first time so you have to push it repeatedly to get it to work. I chose to use my Xbox 360 controller to play the game on the PC, so it made the game easier to control except for aiming. The grenades aren't always tossed according to the dotted line, sometimes it hits invisible barriers and bounces back. This reminded me of Gears of War 2, except GoW had a better cover system.

The bypass, lock pick, and hacking mini-games got tiresome the first 300 times I had to use them. I later learned that having EMP grenades allows you to bypass the games but you can carry a finite number of EMP grenades on you at one time. The checkpoint saving is also very frustrating. To sum up this game, it is like a mix of Mass Effect and Gears of War.

"Hello all, well ill get a few things out of the way, i like action adventure games with or without the blood is fine by me, i also like shooters and survival horror (just read all my reviews). When i first heard about afrika back when the ps3 was just launching i thought ""wow that sounds dumber than all hell"" and it kinda slipt my mind for along time. One day while trying to get demons souls imported i came upon a deal of buy 3 get free shipping (seeing as how the were coming from asia couldn't pass up) so i got demons souls (fantastic) ratchet and clank quest for booty (on a disc and in english) and Hakuna Matata (afrika). At the time i picked these up the only one definetly coming to the u.s. was ratchet so i figured what the heck if i didn't like afrika id sell it. well this game is not leaving my collection.

the pros are

+graphics are really good
+gameplay is rewarding
+its a relaxing break from violence

the cons are

-no voice whatsoever
-none violent (a monkey ran infront of my jeep and brought me to a dead stop)
-if you don't like animals or photography its not for you.

those are the majors for me but i look at it like this,

sometimes i can only play while kids are sleeping and you don't need the sound for this.
my daughter like to watch me play and she is learning from the info in this game as am i.
again no violence means i can play while they watch.

The graphics are excellent, the character creation is super and the mission are very entertaining. Its not a deep-rooted MORPG that people play like its their virtual life. Its a game to have fun with..just go out, be a one man army provide justice to the volience ridden city like only a super hero can and than logout and lead your actual life. I don't want to be spending hours running around shooting bunnies or crafting things for weeks to do anything meaningful(which is the forte of most MORPG out there). I just want a simple game that keeps my character progression and let me have pure fun. The game monthly fees is justified with the ever-changing new content NYC is delivering like 'Through the looking glass update' they just did. Nothing is for free, you watch a movie with your girlfriend you will end up spending twice of what you will pay for this game in a month.

"This game completely redefines the FPS genre.  People say it is the next Halo, I say that you cant even compare the two.  They are two completely different games with two completely different styles.  Ok the first thing about this game that is amazing is the graphics.  I have never seen a more beautiful game.  The next thing is the fighting style, you have to take cover alot, and they make it really fun and interesting to do.  There is a small learning curve, but it is really easy and I think the new control scheme actually makes the game more realistic.  Of course shooting is still the same with the use of the trigger, but to aim you get to use the left trigger.  And you can aim while you are taking cover.  It differs from halo in that it is more strategic.  Instead of jumping in and shooting like a maniac, it actually requires you to take cover and be more  cautious about things.  However it is not completely stealth such as in the splinter cell series. This new formula of combining these two elements makes it very entertaining and realistic.  This is the most realistic game I ever played.  My adrenaline was pumping when the first boss came!  There are few games that I have played that make me jump put of my seat as if I am really there.  If you own a 360 you should already have this game.  If you dont, this game is worth buying a 360 for alone!  One complaint....  no jumping button.  However in reality if you were wearing 300 pounds of gear I don't think you would be able to jump.  That is my only complaint and with the absence of the jump button it actually makes the multiplayer so much more fun.  So not much of a loss there.  I will admit it was frustrating at first, especially since I use jump alot in Halo, but I am really glad with the omission.",5.0,B000FRS9II,AMAZING!,Video Games

"Metal Gear Solid 3 Snake Eater, (said to be the last in the MGS trilogy, although a fourth has been announced) is not only the best game of the year, it is one of the best games ever made.  Gamers disappointed by the story and ""secret"" character in MGS2 Sons of Liberty need not worry; Snake Eater has no huge surprises, (although the plot does twist and turn).

  Snake Eater is a prequel to the first two MGS games; (and actually, I believe, takes place before the original Metal Gear as well).  It takes place in the 1960's, in the jungles of Russia, and as usual, a lone hero, 'Snake', is sent in to stop a nuclear battle tank from launching.

  Snake Eater is an enormous step forward for the series gameplay-wise.  Firstly, no longer do you have a radar.  You'll be utilizing various camaflouged uniforms to blend in to your surroundings and hide from enemies.  Also, since it is in a jungle, hiding from enemies is much more difficult.  No longer can you simply run around a corner or hide in a locker.  There are no corners or lockers, (save for a few instances when you arrive at enemy compounds).  You'll have to hide behind trees, on your belly in tall grass, or even up on a branch.

  New to combat is the CQC (Close Quarters Combat) system.  Get close enough to grab and enemy, and wealth of options are open to you.  Slit his throat; break his neck; throw him to the ground; use him as a human shield while shooting over his shoulder; or interrogate him for information.  Very cool, and very useful.

  Boss fights, and boss characters, as usual, are amazing.  The characters are intriguing, and the fights require skill and brainpower to beat.  PLus, instead of fighting in enclosed areas, some fights take place in the jungle, and one sniper duel in particular spans many screens, and a whole lot of space.

  The graphics are phenomenal, the best seen on the Playstation 2, and easily able to rival graphics found on competing systems.  Faces and character models are accurate and detailed, as well as extremely well animated.  The environments are huge, and varied.  Sun light streams down through the trees, fish swim in fast moving streams, snakes slither by you on the ground, and crocodiles sun themselves on small islands.

  Which brings me to another new aspect of the game: survival.  In addition to your health bar, you now have a stamina bar.  And instead of using rations to increase your health bar, your health will recover automatically over time, and the speed at which it recovers is directly determined by how much stamina you have.  Kill and eat food, (snakes, fruit, mushrooms, deer, rabbits, etc) to regain stamina.  If your stamina drops too low your aim will get shaky, and your wounds won't heal well.

  And on the subject of wounds, another new addition is the treatment of injuries you sustain during the game.  It is done through the pause menu, and you have to treat everything from broken bones, to burns, bullet wounds, and deep cuts.

  Add to all this the amazing story, and writing, plus the always unbelievably voice acting, (the MGS series blows all other games away in this department), and you've got yourself the game of the year.  I strongly suggest purchasing it.  I do not think you will be disappointed.",5.0,B0002RQ3ES,Perfect in Almost Every Way,Video Games

"Square has always been known to develop quality titles and Vagrant Story proves its still one of the best in the game industry. Created by the same team who brought you Final Fantasy Tactics, Vagrant Story offers something quite different yet refreshing to the world of gaming. You are hero Ashley Riot, a Riskbreaker agent who chases the mysterious cult figure Sydney Losstarot into the city of Lea Monde. Throughout the game, you'll attempt to clear your name for being accused of murder while uncovering remnants of your past. Vagrant Story proves you don't need an overly epic storyline to make a game impressive, and this game definitely has one of the best scripts ever written for a video game.

Unlike other big-budget Square titles, which the storyline or visuals are the dominating aspects, gameplay is the star of Vagrant Story. As fair warning, this is NOT a game for casual gamers, which someone can just pick up and play. While battling, you target enemies' bodyparts with the use of a sphere grid. You'll learn to chain combos but your ""risk meter"" will rise, making you more vulnerable. You'll also learn to forge your own weapons and armor, do puzzle-solving and much more. The visuals are outstanding. You feel as if you really did visit Lea Monde with its dungeons and ruins. The character designs are equally amazing and the graphics push the PlayStation to its limits. Sound-wise, the music is hauntingly atmospheric and everything from the grunts and groans of monsters to the sounds of magic spells accent the game perfectly.

Although the difficulty level is a bit high and requires some patience and even frustration, it will still be an interesting but rewarding experience for anyone who really does get into it and understand the gameplay fluidly. The amount of time and effort you put into the game will determine how much fun will you have in the long run. You have to become deeply involved and immersed in order to enjoy Vagrant Story, but once you do, you'll realize you are playing one of the most unique games ever created. It's really like no other, even though it didn't receive enough recognition that it deserved. Give it a chance, it may grow on you.",5.0,B00004SPW9,"Give it a chance, it may grow on you",Video Games

"The reviews given by Amazon authors Joe Juba and Matt Miller are spot-on.  Xenosaga Episode II is very short for an RPG.  And yes, the gameplay has been altered in a negative way.  However, any fan of Xenosaga is obligated to play this game.  Episode II contains exciting and emotional cut scenes, offers further development of the main characters and continues a deep yet interesting storyline.  Just be prepared for a few inferior modifications.

I, too, was disappointed with the change in voice actors, but I saw it coming and therefore wasn't overly bothered by it.  Not everyone sounds different; I only noticed Shion and KOS-MOS with different voices.  Thankfully, the characters' mannerisms and speech patterns have been left intact.  To me, that's what's important.

Another noteworthy downgrade is the music.  Episode I had a full symphony orchestra (with chorus) for it's soundtrack!  Not so with Episode II.  The music isn't bad by any means, but it's nothing that makes me want to buy the soundtrack CD, unlike the first game.  The sound effects are pretty much unchanged.

If you want to collect everything the game has to offer you must take on the optional sub-missions, called GS (Good Samaritan) Campaigns.  There are 36 of them, some of which are quite lengthy.  The time spent on these sub-missions is equal to, if not longer, than the main quest!  There's also Segment Files to discover, which Xenosaga veterans are familiar with.  They should have named this game's title Side-Questsaga.

Also, can anyone tell me why Episode II comprises two disks?  Episode I is only ONE disk, yet it has more cut scenes and is twice as long!  I suppose Episode III will comprise THREE disks and only be 1/3 as long as the first game..!  It's puzzling...

Oh, and why no database in this Xenosaga?  Episode I had a useful database of facts the player could access any time to keep track of all the terms, items and significant events in the game.  It was stupid to drop that feature.  There IS a brief recap of the events from Episode I available to read, but it doesn't make up for a missing database.

The one, single improvement over the first game is the removal of the mail/plug-in module system.  I found it annoying trying not to miss any of the items and information offered by the mail system attachments.  I was glad to see it go in Episode II.

Despite all the negatives, Xenosaga Episode II is still worth playing, at least for fans of Episode I.  Let's just hope for a grander epic in Episode III.  There's plenty to improve at this point.",3.0,B0002CHJAA,Xenosaga's Brief 2nd Chapter,Video Games

Plenty of traveling in this game.  You learn the mystery of Will's past, and more as you travel through dangerous ruins, climb incredible heights, explore many towers, castles and more....
This game fits together so well, you'll end up replaying again and again, to try and find all 50 Jewels (the ultimate side-quest in the game).

Was not that great due to game breaking graphics and gameplay issue.  Characters would not load so you saw only floating spells, meshes clipping in background scenery, sound not loading, freezing, frame rate dips, etc.  I think the game was too much for the XBox 360 or Bioware did a halfhearted job of QCing the older platform versions.  On the Xbox One, the graphics were great, had no freezing, had no freamerate dips, and no loading issues.  Was much easier to get sucked into the game the second time around.  I loved it much more and was sad when it was done.  I will say that the Trespasser DLC seemed like the true ending to the game.  It should have been part of the original game instead of behind a pay wall.  The other DLC was not critical to the game's canon and I have no problem with it being DLC.",4.0,B015OYM2P2,Wonderful Game,Video Games
"SADES Gaming headphones will satisfy you, so long as you go into this expecting to use them only for video games. If you want headphones so you can listen to music, but also want the mic for gaming or Skype, then I'd pass on these, personally. Even tho the product description says ""well defined highs"", in actuality they are muffled, and cloudy. When I plugged these in to a headphone splitter, and listened to them next to better quality headphones, the difference was huge. (Tho maybe its unfair to pay less than twenty dollars for headphones, then expect them to sound like two hundred dollar headphones.) Earphones I've tested in this price range, offer much better highs, than this set. I was listening to a Rolling Stone's song, and wondered, ""What happened to the guitar solo?"" It was there, but barely to be heard.  Also, these are not the most comfortable headphones I've ever worn. There's no padding on the headrest, and the padding around the ears is a bit tight. After an hour or two, you're sure to have headphone fatigue, if you have a large skull.

ON the other hand, if you want gaming headphones, for playing video games, I think these would work great. In fact, if you're gaming for any length of time, the lack of high end would protect your hearing from nerve damage. If you are only listening to people talking, bottom heavy bomb explosions, or gun fire, these headphones will work fine. The mic flips down for on line chat with your gaming partners, or flips up and out of the way, when you need better vision of the screen. There's an ON/OFF switch, for the mic function, right next to the volume control.  I liked the volume control, in case you're getting sick of hearing that video music loop, or have one too many gun shots go off right in your ear.  Just turn it down for a second, while you concentrate on the game controls.  The mic and the headphones work with separate 1/8th inch jacks. Also, the design is simple, and contemporary. For gaming headphones, at this price, you should be happy. My own opinion is FOUR AND A HALF STARS, with the deduction due to the lack of highs, and sonic clarity and response. The bass sounds good, though. You shouldn't be disappointed there.

"Skylanders has to be the best use of an idea that I've seen to date:  it hits the kid-trifecta of video game/toy/collectible.  It makes parents happy with its game rating and content, and while it is only loosely based on Spyro the Dragon, I get the impression my dragon-loving daughter could care less because she's having too much fun.

If you're not familiar with the idea, here it is:  Skylanders are creatures (including Spyro) from another world who have been trapped inside little toy figurines.  The Skylanders game comes with a ""Portal of Power"", a wireless base that you can put within reach of you while you play the game.  When you plunk a Skylander figure down on the Portal of Power, they come to life in the game (and the Starter Pack gives you three).  Within the game world, everything looks like a fantasy playset.  Players go on adventures helping the little creatures that live in each world (and we get some entertaining voice acting, such as Patrick Warburton).  Each Skylander has unique powers, and each falls into one of several types (Fire, Water, Air, Tech, etc.).

Each figurine has its own skills.  Each type is useful--and sometimes necessary--to complete certain parts of a level.  You'll hear ""Skylanders of the Air type are stronger here"", or see ""A Fire type Skylander is necessary to unlock this door""...plunk the right type down on the Portal and you're ready to go.  The goal of the game is to enjoy trying out all the different kinds of Skylanders and switch them about on the fly, so it never gets boring.  And as each figurine ""levels up"", the money you gather along the way will let you buy various powers and upgrades, but all of it stays with that toy.  Take the toy over to a friend's house, drop it on their Portal of Power, and you're playing right alongside them, with all your skills and levels.  It's even ""platform-agnostic"", which means any Skylanders figure will work on any machine at any time:  the PS3, the Wii, the Nintendo DS, and even the PC.  My daughter plays on the PS3 and her friend has the Wii--both games play anyone's Skylanders without a hitch.

The dark side of Skylanders is the 'collectible' part.  As you play the game, you'll unlock goodies that certain Skylanders can have.  You'll see an animation of the Skylander and a clip of how they work in the game...but you can't play that Skylander and give them the goodie if you don't have the toy for that Skylander.  And some toys are less common than others.  Some are in more demand, and many are selling online by adults who make the rounds at your local toy stores and buy up everything in sight.  While the initial run of Skylanders is 32 figurines, there are most likely plans to make more kinds, but the ones that have been made won't be made forever:  their production run is limited.  Your child doesn't have to have every Skylander to enjoy the game (and maybe they shouldn't!) but chances are you'll run across one particular hard-to-find Skylander that your child really wants to have, and then you'll have to decide how much you're willing to pay for it.  Amazon is your friend:  they connected me to someone with Cynder--girl characters are hard to find, and she is my daughter's favorite.

Still, Skylanders is tremendous fun to play.  It is colorful, it allows two players to play together with the ability for either player to come and go if they want to quit, and it even tags figures to the savegame in which they were unlocked.  This last doesn't change gameplay in any way, it just means that if you have two siblings with their own figures, each can have their own savegames that note that the figure was first plunked down in that savegame.  Siblings with duplicate Skylanders can give each nicknames to tell them apart.  And as if that wasn't enough, the Expansion Sets are a clever, clever way to add more to the game--drop the figure for the expansion on the Portal of Power and the expansion playset gets dropped into the Skylanders world for play.  My daughter has a 'health potion' that you can put on the Portal once per level, and while it's there, players' health regenerates for a period of time.  Amazing stuff.

I tell ya, if we'd had Skylanders when I was a kid, chances are I would have totally ignored 'that Star Wars thing that everyone seems to be talking about.'  Skylanders is pure play/toy/game heaven.",4.0,B004VQEO2E,Pure Play Perfection,Video Games

There is even a driver option where the device locks itself in a mode called ""Tournament Mode"" with a ""T"" displaying on the device's display for those who compete in fighting game tournaments, where turbo function et al are disabled.

The converter is made with solid plastic and is pretty durable. I've dropped it once or twice and carried it around a lot in a bag and it still works to this day. The converter fits well into USB inputs and does not budge when wiggled. One thing though is that USBs inserted into the converter's USB input has to go in upside-down. It's not really a problem and is more likely a design choice to make the device itself small and compact.

Continuing on with the device's list of caveats:

- The initial set-up was a little difficult. Instructions can be found on their website, but it was also a bit difficult navigating ConsoleTuner's site for the instructions.
- The device requires a WIRED controller for the console of choice of which you want to get another controller to work on. So for example, if you want to get an Xbox One controller to work on PS4, you will need a PS4 controller.
- Every time you remove the converter from the console, the device does not retain the output of the device, so you will have to set-up the converter again if it leaves the console's USB. However, the converter will identify controllers within seconds.
- Apparently the PS4 has issues with the converter's compatibility requiring the device to reboot itself every 10 minutes. ConsoleTuners is currently working on a workaround, but PS4 owners will have to deal with that. The rebooting process takes like a second, but in a competitive setting, this is an issue.

Other than that, for $70, you can't go wrong with this converter. It's a solid buy if you can get around its caveats. No modding or real computer skills required.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To convert a controller:

1: Insert converter into the USB input of console of choice (e.g. PS4).
2: Insert the wired input of the console's controller (e.g. PS4 controller) into converter's USB input upside-down.
3: Wait a bit. The converter will identify the controller and will display a notification that the controller has been identified.
4: Remove controller's wired USB from the converter.
5: Insert the wired input of desired controller (e.g. Xbox One controller) into the USB of the device upside-down.
6: Wait a bit. The converter will identify the Xbox One controller and convert its signal into the console of choice.

"This game is...amazing at the least. I have never been a fan of the FPS genre, yet UT2004 turned my piont of view completely around. Before this game, I have never played UT. I would say it is also a fairly reasonable entrance to the UT franchise

Graphics. Yes, it is the year 2008 (or later, depending on when you are reading this review), so I will not be harsh on the game's graphics. For its time, UT2004 has stunning graphics. Throughout the game, you will have many of those breath-taking moments were you can see a gorgeous map in all its glory.

Sound. Appropriately technological. The sound builds on the supspense in the game, and seems to fit in very well with the levels. It is not really anything to take notice of, just there. Weapon sounds are good, but do not really vary, it is tedious hearing the same sounds over and over while using a weapon. If you play the game without sound, you are not really missing anything big.

Gameplay. This is where UT stands out, the gameplay in this game is superb. The game is polished to the extent that you will never really notice any bugs. The game comes with 15 unique weapons, each with at least one atternate firing mode. For example, the rocket launcher can fire a single rocket (LMB/RMB), it can fire two of three rockets (hold RMB), it can fire multiple rockets in a spiral pattern (hold RMB and tap LMB), and finnaly, it can lock on to a target (hold crosshair over an enemy). Each of the weapons are unique and extremely balanced. For this Epic's game policy is ""No weapon is completely overpowering, but in the right hands, any weapon can be overpowering."" There are olso vehicles in the popular onslaught game mode. Each one is completely original and fun to use. Along with that you have close to 150 maps to play in plus downloadable content and the ablity to create your own maps.

Multiplay. Well, the whole game is for multiplayer. And although there is a single player mode, it is a little bland in terms of fun. But with real opponents, the fun just never stops! If you do not have internet connection, this game is not really for you.

Replayability. It is just impossible to stop loving this game.

Story. No story, well at least, not really. In the assault modes, there is a glimmer of a story line that tells the history of the Unreal universe, but it is utterly confusing, and doesn't really give you any motivation to play this game.

UT2004 is a fun, and polished shooter that is right up there with Halo and Call of Duty.

"I like this game because it fixed the big problems of its predecessor PG3D Assault. Firstly, it only costs 1 slot for any unit regardless of experience level. This means I no longer have to put up with ridiculous 3 to 1 or even 5 to 1 odds.

Secondly, the crashes when I ambush the computer are gone.

The units also are better animated than before. Now, you see things like tanks traversing their turrets towards their targets to fire.

However, this game creates new headaches. I don't like the numerous exit-this-many-units-off-the-map-by-8turns or you lose scenarios. They are unrealistic. I don't know of any real WW2 battle where something like this had to be done. The time table for these operations are also way too short.

This game is also stingier than PG3D Assault in giving out promotions and extra roster slots.

"I'm sure some of you have played an online, anime-based dating sim before. A bunch of them are great, albeit weird.

I got this when DS first came out (so there were only a handful of decent games) and it was o.k. It's a very straight forward concept with an extremely shallow overtone. Sure, it's a dating sim, but the objective is clear: they wanted to appeal to a larger American demographic by making it like some rich kid MTV 'reality' show.

The gameplay (if you wish to call it such) is linear and there is very little room for movement. Sure there are alternate endings, but they have very subtle differences. Sound is okay; it's very generic and over time very unbearable.

The restricted nature, low replay value, and poor story line makes this game barely passable if you're a dating sim fan, and I'd assume less so if you weren't. It is relatively short, and aside from using a whopping two characters, not really worth another go (unless you missed stuff and wanted to get a better ending).

"Wow... EA are you serious? Sometimes, I think they just needed to fill a PS3 quota with this conversion. I also think they have inexperienced/inadequate development teams working on some of their titles. And apparently, when going in and fixing this or that is too costly or time consuming, they just add a new feature or two to gloss over the remaining crappy elements included in this title. I bought this game with little expectations, I read the reviews and said, how bad can it be? I've played Live 08, and it wasn't that bad. But this is BAD!!! The frame rate, as you may have read is really the issue. Players jerk and jostle about. You'll step out of bounds without trying, get locked into an animation as you go to the net and again, run out of bounds. The opponent double teams and intentional fouls you if you're winning with less than a minute to go - which sends you out of bounds to pass it in - which is incredibly annoying the 5th time it happens. But it's not all bad. I like the college feel, the arenas feel alive, the mascots, cheerleaders, etc. all feel like NCAA football. The low post play is pretty solid, as you can rely on an easy bucket by flicking the right analog stick when the defense posts up and move right on around him. Most players instead of a dunk do a up and under move that's pretty reliable as well. Still, the frame rate is the biggest nail in this games coffin. And where is the game you see in the screen shots? or even in the in-game opening preview after the title screen? A few more close ups of the pretty decent looking player models would be nice, heck if they can get the graphic quality to anything close to what you see when you win or lose and congratulate the other team, then this might be something to write a positive review about. But nope, it's just skinny kids playing ball. Eh, skip it!

Add-on 8/29: After playing this game awhile, it's starting to grow on me. Yeah the above issues are still there. But, if you slow the game down on the sliders to a snails pace, the gameplay is actually quite solid. I've enjoyed the mini games before each game and I like how it transitions from the playground to the arena, where all the fans cheer or boo as you make and miss shots. The recruiting part is actually kind of fun, sending emails, packages, scholarships, etc. are all fun. And like I said before, as college goes, it's really cool to play in the arena's with the mascots, fans, cheerleaders, etc. That might be because I didn't go to a big school, so I missed out. But I can get it all here in the comfort of my own home. Not a bad game. But still I hear College Hoops is the one to get.",2.0,B000WSE3BC,March MAD-ness indeed!,Video Games

"Temple of Elemental Evil, for better or worse, is unlike any game you have ever played.  This is a true, nut-and-bolt recreation of pen and paper Dungeons and Dragons.  The rules are extremely complicated and detailed, and the game takes place in turns.  Thus, it plays more like a turn-based strategy game than past RPGs like Baldurs Gate and Neverwinter Nights.  A simple combat against five bandits might take 60 seconds in previous games, but it can take 10 minutes in this game.  In general, the pace of this game is very slow.  I think that Troika did a great job of making a game that is both faithful to D&D rules and fun, but the game is really lacking some basic features.
By now, you have probably figured out that this game is not for everyone.  It isn't.  If you don't like +1 bonuses, die rolls, and inane rules, then you are going to hate this game.  However, if you are like me and you like a lot of this stuff, then this game seems like Nirvana.  It's almost a perfect recreation of D&D, and it's very efficient.  All of the rules, feats, skills, spells, and actions have been distilled down into a simple set of menus and screens that you can access with a few mouse clicks.  For the most part, it's intuitively set up and very easy to use.  The radial menu system works great.  If you know the D&D rules well, then you will be at full speed in no time.
It's impossible to overstate what an accomplishment this is.  You just right click on a character and by navigating the mouse, you can either drink a potion from your inventory, use the ""Power attack"" feat, or cast a Magic Missile spell.  The ease of use is one of the reasons why the game stays fun.
Combat in ToEE is the most fun and satisfying part.  The battles are extremely hard and they require you to utilize all of the tactical tricks that you can think of.  The turn-based system is what allows you to do this and get anything out of it.  I enjoyed the combat in this game more than Baldurs Gate or Neverwinter Nights for this reason.  The game doesn't blow by too fast for you to use your abilities without pressing the space bar over and over.
This game has surprisingly good graphics.  The pre-rendered 2D backgrounds are simply the most beautiful that I have ever seen.  They are not only gorgeous, but full of variety.  The monsters are also richly detailed, not to mention menacing.  The monsters are also the best that I have ever seen in an RPG.  My only complaint with the graphics is how tiny your party is on the screen.  You can hardly tell your characters apart without squinting, and you can't tell what they are carrying or wearing by glancing at them.  The inventory screen is also very unattractive and the items are very bland.  Baldurs Gate and Neverwinter Nights have much more attractive inventory screens.
I love the soundtrack for this game, but the voice acting is pretty sub par.  A few of the characters have good voice acting, but for the most part, it's not very good.
This game does have some problems that slow it down unnecessarily.  One of them is the inability to set hotkeys.  Customizable hotkeys was one of the great things about Neverwinter Nights.  Unfortunately, in Temple of Elemental Evil, in order to give a command 20 times, you have to go through it in the radial menu 20 times.  It gets old.  The map screen stinks, because you can only place a limited number of flags on it, and because you can't use it to jump to a spot on the big screen,  Finally, the manual that comes in the box is totally inadequate.  You need to buy the Dungeons and Dragons Players Handbook to understand a lot of what is going on (if you don't already know).  I see this as being a huge flaw for someone who is not intimately familiar with the rules.
I really enjoyed this game, and I hope that we will see more Dungeons and Dragons games from Troika.  As I said previously it is not for everyone.  If you like planning and strategy, then I think that you will like this game.  You might want to get a strategy guide with it, because this is also the hardest D&D game ever made.",4.0,B00009MGVE,"Promising, but lacking some basics",Video Games

"Ladies and Gentlemen... I give you Madden 06 for the XBox 360.

Madden 06?  Well...  yeah.  This is the version that should have been for 06.  2007 at the least.  But we won't harp on that - we'll just go off of this game and what we have here now.  And what we have here now is a pretty good game, I must admit.

To start off, let's remember that Madden 07 SUCKED.  Plain and simple.  If you thought otherwise, then... well, to quote the late Rick James: ""Cocaine is a hell of a drug.""  I reviewed it harshly, but accurately.  (It's the first one that displays)  I said - nay - SWORE that I would not buy another EA football or basketball title until they showed us, as consumers, that they were interested in putting out a quality product and less interested in that '#1 Selling Franchise' logo on the box every year.  I missed playing football games, as I usually do around this time of year, so I picked up NCAA 08.  I enjoy the college versions usually, and that one was no different.  Some of the upgrades on there had me a little curious about what they had in store for this year's Madden, so I kept my eyes open.  But I swore to myself - RENT first.

So I did... played a few games, different modes, etc.  Then a funny thing happened.  I went right back out and bought it.  Wow...  didn't see that coming.  And even more surprising than that, I guess, for some - the FAR BETTER version is on the 360 and NOT the PS3.

So let's see... where to start.  I'll start with the cons, since there aren't many of them this year, surprisingly.  But the ones that ARE there are biggies, and keep this game out of the 'Great' category and firmly in the 'Very Good' area.  (still better than last year's 'Rancid Camel $&?!#' rating)

New England is rated at a 97.  Okay, that's not really a 'con' but COME ON...  a 97?  Really??  Anyway...

Presentation - pitiful.

For a game that has exclusive rights to the ESPN brand, this is really horrible.  Games past utilized FAR superior presentation styles - including those that were ESPN licensed.  With all of the classic on-air/broadcast personalities over at ESPN, all they could come up with was Marshall Faulk doing a glazed-over pre/post game two-liner?  All-Pro Football 2K8 was a half-hearted attempt by the 2K Crew, yet it is not UTTERLY behind Madden - why?  Presentation.  The audio commentary, the little subtleties in the gameplay: players actually talking to one another and the ref, players getting out of the way of oncoming traffic while standing on the sidelines, etc.  Why does this seem to remain just out of EA's scope of imagination?  Play-by-Play is still a joke this go-round.  Madden was never on par with the classic 2K series, but this radio broadcast thing - doesn't work for me, and from what I'm hearing - doesn't work for most others.  I actually miss Madden's painfully OBVIOUS-isms. (""What you wanna do is... you wanna score more points than the other team, because THAT will put you in a better position to win the game.""  Thanks for that pearl of wisdom there, JM) Also gone is the ability to truly customize your menu playlists.  I hate that.  I want my own music.  Period.

I don't play online as much as in the past, but one rather large omission I noticed was the lack of Online Leagues.  Hmmmm...  that seems like it would add MILES of replayability, yet again, it's nowhere to be found.  Disappointing, moreso for some I'm sure.

And of course there are a few gameplay issues, but that's to be expected.  AI has been drastically improved, but there are still moments when your DB's and LB's will prove to be mildly retarded.
You fumble FAR too often on this game - the ball is too easily jarred loose, thanks in large part to the Hit Stick controls, but after awhile you kinda get used to it a bit. (annoying in itself)

EA 4th Quarters are still in effect: No matter how badly you've been destroying a team for 3 quarters, they will manage to drive down and score on you in the 4th.  Bumping the difficulty up a notch or two helps somewhat this year - I keep it on All-Madden.  Speaking of AI - how about a little AI upgrade for the crowd, coach and sideline players?  The fans are still there, cheering like psychos, even though their team is down by 48 in the closing seconds of the game.  Not likely...  The sideline players are still over there in their overly-generic animations, all moving in sync with each other - looks like an old Michael Jackson video.  And my coach, even in the snow, is over there getting his Kanye West on with a short-sleeved polo shirt and a headset.  36 degrees out, Coach...

There's still no way to save mid-game, though they did incorporate the SuperSim feature from NCAA 08.  You can (pre-game or pre-play selection) choose to simulate the entire game, quarter, half, possession or play.

The other biggie (besides the presentation) is the Special Teams play.  It effectively serves no purpose on this game.  The kicking game is still overly simplistic, every kicker has the ability to kick the ball out of the stadium, there are no useful adjustments for kickoff/punt formations (wedge, etc.)  Also, if the other team DOES manage to score, expect an onside kick.  50-point deficit in the 4th still?  Onside kick...  Why?  WHY???  Football is, when you get down to it, made up of 3 elements: Offense, Defense and Special Teams.  That's 1/3 of the game.  1/3 that they failed to represent.  Can't have a 'Great' game with those percentages.

Thankfully, the rest of the game is rather outstanding.

Graphically, the game is so far ahead of last year's it's not even funny.  Gone are the kickers with the 27-inch pythons.  You can tell Peyton Manning apart from Brian Urlacher.  Players are far more realistically portrayed in this installment.  Slow down a HB in the open field just long enough for 2 of your DB's and a safety to swarm in and gang tackle him into the turf. (FINALLY!!!!!)  The new animations (literally hundreds) make for a much smoother and free-flowing gaming experience, and the intuitive button configuration (fully customizable, of course) helps in just jumping straight into a game.

The stadiums are very nicely done, and the field looks phenomenal - PARTICULARLY during bad weather.  You see the destruction of the field in the heavy traffic areas, and it progresses throughout the game.  Even the rain itself tapers on and off throughout.  One suggestion:  how about some splashing, and more evidence of the messy weather on the uniforms/helmets.  The lack of water splashing kind of takes away from the beauty of the huge pools of water that you are being forced to hike the ball from.

Aside from the radio broadcaster, the sound is brilliant.  On-field trash talking, stadium announcer - everything is there.  The tackling sounds will actually have you cringe occasionally... especially if it's one of YOUR players that just got their head knocked off.

I mentioned the AI - leaps and bounds over 07.  Minus a few lapses here and there, you really have to use some THOUGHT when playing.  I actually enjoy PUNTING now!!  Throw to a receiver near the sidelines, and watch him (gasp) actually make an attempt to stay inbounds while catching the ball.  Loose ball?  Be amazed at how a mad dash will instantly ensue.  Gone are the days when a goalline stand was a mere formality.  1st and Goal on the one?  Don't be surpised if you end up with 3 points...

All of the other gameplay features appear to be back, more or less.  Instead of a dedicated 'Owner Mode' you can check in the Front Office menu and observe how your Franchise is running.  Check prices (can't adjust them though), revenue, expenses... even RELOCATE your team somewhere more profitable if your market is slow with the money.  Drafts, stats, roster management - pretty much the norm.  And all of the other little stuff, like the Rings, Trophies, yadda yadda - not that much into that crap, but they're there if you want them.  Connect to XBox Live and the ESPN Ticker will keep you updated with current stats and news in real time.  (I got several Michael Vick updates yesterday... nice)

Madden annually introduces some new gimmick to the franchise in an attempt to make it 'fresh' - this year brings us the Weapons System.  While it can use some tweaking for sure, this is - to me - the single best addition to this franchise since the ability to change your pass coverage came along.  Along with the traditional ratings system, you now have a Weapons system, labeling players by their strenghts and tendencies.  No longer are two 99-rated WR's mirror images of one another.  Steve Smith and T.O. are both great receivers for different reasons.  L.T. and L.J. are definitely different types of backs, but you'd never know it on previous Maddens.  Power backs play differently that elusive backs; Speed receivers go differently than possession receivers.  For every Weapon, there is a counter Weapon.  Hard Hitters can counter a Power HB by taking their legs out from under them consistently, but would have a harder time taking out an elusive back - while THEY would have more trouble with a Brick-Wall defender or LockDown defender.  See?  And it's up to you to set mismatches and play to your strengths and your opponent's weaknesses.  Smart players - there's nothing you can really do to counter them outside of choosing a vast variety of plays - don't become predictable.  Once your Smart Player's icon illuminates fully, they are able to see the play art of the opponent.  QB's will see the defense's plan - LB's will see the offensive play between the hash marks.  This all adds up to provide a football experience than Madden lovers haven't had, arguably, ever.

So how does it rate?  A solid 4 out of 5 for me.  The presentation and gameplay issues I mentioned earlier keep it from the 4.5-5 realm, but the KEY is that they are progressing.  The REAL TEST will be when 09 comes out - what will that be like?  Hopefully it's a step forward and not backwards, which has been EA's pattern over the past few years.

Is it the best football game ever?  No.
Is it better than 2K5?  Not hardly.
Is it the best football game for 08?  I'd have to say yes... slight nod over NCAA 08 (though the collegiate 'little brother' does more on the presentation end)
Is it better than Madden 07?  Ridiculously so, but again - that's not saying much.  So how about this:
Is it the best Madden ever?  Hmmm... that's tough.  It's at least where 05 was, which was arguably the best Madden.  I've had more fun with this year's Madden than I have in a LONG time.  So for me, I'd have to say... yes.

Much improved - very good effort from EA.  It's about time.  This game is a few gameplay tweaks, a massive presentation overhaul, and some miscellaneous additions (tats, unique animations, custom soundtracks, etc.) from being something TRULY special.  But thanks for finally giving me something to look forward to again each August.

"This game is pretty much what you'd expect if you've been playing Kart in all its incarnations for a while. Steering with the wiimote adds a fun element that is a bit hard to get used to at first, but does add some interest to the steering.

The wii wheel was kind of dumb. I finally just took my wiimote out of the wheel, because with a wheel, I want to, you know, turn it like a steering wheel! But in order to get anywhere you need to tip the wiimote back and forth. Steering normally does nothing, and the wheel was just frustrating because it made me want to steer rather than tilt back and forth.

The other annoying thing is that with multiplayer, you can't play the races straight through without interruptions (Grand Prix), and you can't seem to select between 50 cc, 100 cc, and 150 cc. I miss that. I play almost exclusively multi, so not being able to choose the cc level is annoying, as is having to choose the next level manually every time, even after choosing the ""next race"" option. Just takes some of the flow out of the game for me.

That said, the levels are cool, the new karts are fun, and I am so enjoying having some new Kart action after all this time.

"Had very high hopes for using this corded, and time tested controller in new smash brothers four for Wii U.  Yes it programs commands (I first created two macros for short hopping + instant in air smash as its tricky under fire to pull off).

BE WARNED.  Sadly, the B button on this device - BRAND NEW mind you, is terribly unresponsive and requires really forcing your thumb into what feels like placing a puzzle for the dang button to register. Worse, once you've pressed and are holding down B, the controller doesn't register you holding it down, as it slips around and requires crushing power (following a response delay that cannot be overcome by strength) just to execute any moves than require, uh... B.  I paid as much as a new controller for this, and perhaps note no other issues with any of the buttons - will possibly reconfigure the keys around as in smash having both x and y and the analog pad up serve as a jumping action is a little overkill.

"Video games have been stealing from the ""Evil Dead"" movies for quite some time now. Take Duke Nukem, for instance - he really wants to be Ashley Williams, when it's all said and done, and that's why he steals the ""Evil Dead"" hero's quips whenever he spills the entrails of some invading alien. Oh, and what of Caleb, the undead anti-hero of the ""Blood"" series? Yes, he too owes the majority of his one-liners to Mr. Williams - who we have come to know as `Ash.' Let's face it, ""Evil Dead"" is the perfect movie-to-game property, and Ash, chainsaw-armed hero of the films, is the perfect gaming bad@$$. When it comes right down to it, it doesn't even matter how well ""Evil Dead: A Fistful of Boomstick"" plays, provided Bruce Campbell returns to voice Ash. Fortunately for us ""Evil Dead"" fanatics, Campbell is back, and the game plays pretty darn well too. You're in for some good, unclean fun, you primitive screwheads.
The story picks up sometime after the end of the third film, and we find Ash tilting a few back in his favorite bar in his quaint hometown of Dearborn, Michigan. Naturally, things aren't quaint for very long. A spectacle-toting professor reads an ancient arcane passage from the Deadites' favorite book on a local television broadcast, and it all goes downhill from there. The inhabitants of Dearborn begin to change into slavering undead freaks - and it's up to Ash and his boomstick to save the day.
The storyline is appropriately campy in a fashion that is consistent with the franchise, but otherwise unremarkable. Just the same, it provides all the motivation you will require to dismember hordes upon hordes of Deadites. The game plays out in a way best described as ""Tomb Raider"" meets ""The Thing,"" and the action, while a little bit on the repetitive side, is slick and bloody. Ash will uncover more ways to dispose of the opposition than you, as the player, will ever have time to use in one play-through, and it's just plain addictive. Some puzzles crop up to offset the mayhem, and they provide some welcome cerebral moments that are rarely illogical.
During the course of the game, Ash will venture through present day (but Deadite-infested) Dearborn, colonial Dearborn, Civil War era Dearborn, and post-apocalyptic Dearborn. This time travel scenario provides some much-appreciated variety in the locales, and an ""Army of Darkness"" ambience besides. It all looks pretty nice too - crisp and colorful, and fraught with detail. Only the segments of the game that take place in the forests around Dearborn are unattractive, point of fact, and that's saying something when you consider that this is a budge title retailing at about $20. What's more, the character models, while not bursting with detail, are very well animated, and usually quite convincing.
Any ""Evil Dead"" fan looking forward to this game is probably asking: ""So, how are Ash's one-liners?"" The answer to that is this: not bad, but not half as well-written as the ones from the films (which is to be expected). Even so, Bruce Campbell's delivery compensates for even the worst of them, and his vocal presence alone is worth the price of admission. Besides, there are some hidden gems scattered here and there that will tickle Deadite aficionados in all the right places. Add to that some well-made cut-scenes (and a BRILLIANT finale), and you've got the closest thing to ""Evil Dead 4"" you're going to see... at least for quite some time.
It's not all unbridled joy, though. The game is a bit on the short side, and requires a lot of backtracking and errand running. Boss battles are not very intense, and the solutions to defeating them are all but spelled out for you in a most unsubtle fashion. As an ""Evil Dead"" fan myself, I was also a bit disappointed by some of the enemies in the game, which don't really fit in the ""Evil Dead"" universe, and seem to have come instead from an entirely different game.
As a game, without any other considerations, ""Evil Dead: Fistful of Boomstick"" is good. It plays well, offers a few scares and a few laughs, and a whole lot of M-rated action. As an ""Evil Dead"" fanatic, the game delivers all of the above and the added delight of revisiting Ashley Williams and watching him kick all kinds of Deadite @$$. Finally, as a budget title, this game represents pure excellence. In a rare twist of fate, just because you're paying less doesn't mean you're getting less. Hail to the king, baby.

"As you know, I gave a pretty harsh rating to Rainbow Six 3 due to its online bugs which are history now (Action Replay and Molotov Cocktails to name a few) and the decent at best menu music really disturbed my judgement of the game. What Black Arrow does is give us what wasn't available to us in RS3 (2 new online modes, lone rush, co-op) but it's those few online bugs that gives this game one star less than what it deserves.

Pros: 1. Lone Rush Mode (kill terrorists alone like Schwartzenegger!)

2. Co-op terrorist hunts and missions (play with a friend, and it's cordless too!)

3. New Multiplayer modes (Total Conquest has you control all three satellites for 20 seconds from the other team and Retrieval is like CTF, except with a cannister instead of a flag, same objective though)

4. Xbox Live 3.0 is fully utilized (clan support, voice messaging, and clan competitions!)

5. New menu music (it actually rocks!)

6. Improved AI and sound (terrorists actually put emphasis in being shot or spotting you)

Cons: 1. Online Bugs. I will just explain these bugs to you. As I said before, these bugs were the only reason that I gave this game a 4-star instead of a 5-star. Trust me, the online in whole is a good experience, but it is these bugs that taint the image of the game. Here are the bugs that you will encounter in your online quest.

One, The AOL-ism when you enter a game. Once you enter a game, you go through the loading screens, map loading, and so on. And then you get through into a game you hear people on the speakers or headset, you hear music,... but all of a sudden, the music and chatter stops, and after 1-3 seconds, you see an play screen with no movement except for the loading circle on the bottom. About 5 seconds later, I found myself sitting in the main menu. Not only that, but it also boots you from the Xbox live service and you have to reconnect to the Live service! I have discovered that I can rarely get into a game when they are actually playing. I must wait until the game goes back into the waiting lobby before I can join it! Hopefully, Ubisoft will release a patch to fix this up (Apparently, there are always online bugs with the Ubisoft games. RS3 (Action Replay), SC-PT (quit and don't lose points and game is not ranked), and this game to be specific. What are the online testers doing?)

Two, Spawn Camping. UUUUUUGGGGGHHHHH!!! This problem is basically a problem with the newer online modes, where another team gets through to their spawn and just shoots everyone on the other team that respawns. Not only does it agitate the team that is getting spawn killed, but it takes the fun out of the game as well (I expected a challenge, not to just shoot people respawning!). I'll admit it to you, I have spawn killed before (did not initiate it, but joined in the process) and it is only fun to do for about 30 seconds to a minute, then it just gets boring. Either because you get sick of it, or the other team just quit or stopped respawning. And the attacking team has the advantage as well since you cannot move for a half second where they just shoot you and you, yes, die. Once again, where are the online testers on this sort of thing. Shouldnt Ubisoft have put up barriers on spawns or a time limit for being in the opponents spawn area (10 seconds tops) but no, We have to suffer until Ubisoft puts out a patch to stop this madness.

Three, you quit and your stats do not count for the game. It's self-explanitory. quit and the game will not count for or against you, it's not as bad as splinter cell where a player quit and the game didn't count, but it still irks me that this hasn't been fixed for a game that has been released AFTER Splinter Cell.

Final Verdict: I would still buy this game, since many people will abandon RS3 for the expansion pack, and besides, if you look past the online bugs, it is a very good game. and it's only $40. Good price for the game.",4.0,B00025EJ1E,"Great solo campaign, but frustrating online bugs deceive me",Video Games

"It's a wired / wireless mouse, and can be operated either off the nano-wireless receiver or the USB charging cable. As the battery life is terrible, only about 6-10 hours (and that's in power saving mode,) you will find you need to keep it charged whenever not in use, keep spare rechargeable batteries around, or plug it in and use it that way. With the weight of the mouse, it SHOULD have used 2 AA rechargeable batteries instead of 1 to at least give you a full day of usage.

Unfortunately the Logitech charging cable is thick and very stiff, needlessly so. As an alternative, I just use a regular micro-USB cable which works fine. It doesn't have the strain-relief of the Logitech, but as it's rather thin it seems to be fine.

The software is horrible both from a design and coding viewpoint. For example, in the definable profiles, you can set the DPI and report rate. For some reason, it takes 4 seconds for it to respond to a click changing the report rate or DPI up and down arrows. I don't know how anyone could possibly code something to perform this poorly on a core i7-3930K,  but not only should they be fired, but they should be barred from ever working in the software industry again. From a design perspective, you can assign multi-key macros to the extra buttons. The UI is bizarre though, you can enter key strokes but in order to also include mouse events, you have to right click on the keystroke window and choose insert mouse event....  Very non-intuitive. At the very least there should be an on-screen note to right click to do other actions. Also, in a macro, there is no way to have the macro send one thing on button down, and another on button up (which would be VERY useful.)

All that said, as a mouse, it works very well. It tracks fast and accurately and despite the design flaws of the software, once you set it up you are good to go. Being able to change DPI on the fly is awesome, as is having multiple profiles. For this reason, I'm giving it 4 stars but can't give it 5 stars due to the flaws listed above. You would think after being in the mouse business for so long Logitech would be 5 stars every time, but this just isn't the case with this mouse.

Update1: The USB receiver failed and I had to work with support to get it replaced. Really - that's a part that should never fail.

Update2: The left mousebutton has gone bad and now doubleclicks all the time meaning I have to throw this thing out. Highly disappointing in a mouse this expensive.",2.0,B00BFOEY3Y,"Heavy, cord too stiff, mousebuttons don't last",Video Games

I did have to turn down a few things using the custom settings, but it still looks good. I only turned a few things like the brightness to medium. All other settings are at high. This game could run smoother and it would advised to wait a month or so to let the guys at the bug desk, fix things and release a patch. It seems it was rushed to compete with COD Ghosts. Also, if your in the small launch trying to make it through the high seas to get back to the Valkyrie, don't waste 30 minutes trying to keep up and get to the ship.

I'd bet anything the designers wanted and needed more test time, but just like Obamacare, the guys at the top rushed it and now it's a mess. The game makers need more control over their products.

The main character, Faith, is unlikeable. The ending was terrible in my opinion. If you're going to play this game for the story, you're going to be sadly disappointed.

Gameplay: It's all about parkour and combat. You'll be climbing/ sliding/ jumping through different obstacles. The open-world game was not a bad idea, but clearly, there's was a huge potential. Combat feels weird. This game clearly wants you to always be moving, but the combat prevents it. There's only two types of attacks: your standard normal and heavy. While you are able to knock your opponent in a different direction, the problem is the whole combat system. They honestly should've had a combo system against the enemies within the game. Also, the enemies aren't that great. Only one would try to fight you while the others would just watch their own teammates get their ass whoop. You have gadgets within the game, but AGAIN there is a huge potential for the use of gadgets in combat.

Overall, the parkour was great. But, the combat is honestly bad. And this game is %50 parkour and %50 combat (Not to mention you can't pick up enemies weapon and use it against them.) With the add of a mediocre story, this game is just average. Buy this game at most $15 (since I bought here for that price.)",3.0,B00ZDYJ9P0,"5/10 Parkour...Check, Combat....... uhhhh",Video Games

"I got this game the day it came out for PS3. I definitely have enjoyed it a lot and think it's a heavy contender for game of the year. Some reviews have said it's too easy. I guess that depends how hardcore of a gamer you are. I guess I would consider myself a casual gamer, as I don't have time with work and a family to play all the time, but when I do play, it's games like this that I really enjoy.

The graphics and sound make for a really immersive experience, especially if you have good surround sound. There were numerous times I had goose bumps and was actually spooked a few times. Also, you are selling yourself short if you aren't set up for HDTV with the quality of games today. Playing this game on anything but 1080p is a disjustice to the game and your personal experience.

This game adds some different skills to the typical first person shooter. I really like the zero gravity. And the storyline is top notch and molds seamlessly with the game.

"Okay let me first say that when i first saw this game when I was 7 years old I was intrigued.  The year was 1987.  The power-ups hidden in the game were a thrill to find.  Learning all the maps proved most difficult and beating Kraid, the boss of the underground was as far as I got for years.  Why?  Cause I always ended up copying the stupid complicated password down wrong and could not continue. (Its crazy if you didn't already know.)
I finally beat the game in my sophmore year of highschool (without any outside help) after exploring every crany nook with my bombs and having the map of the entire game practically memorized.  That my friends is key to metroid, memorizing where you have gone which proved most difficult to do when I was a child.  Yes I killed Kraid, went to the statues and blasted Motherbrain to oblivion, and finally beat the hardest game in my youth - next to Kid Icarus- still haven't beaten it and probly never will...
This game my friends is old school, no hand holding like in Super Metroid with the maps that tell you in what land you are in, the map is in your head, (of course now you can always look up the map on the internet, something old school gamers never had), and you should stay away from this game unless you are a gamer gamer if you know what I mean.  The only thing that bogs my mind is that they sell this game for around $5 while the more recent Metroid Prime also sells for around $5.

"In this game you start off as a boy named Sorata but eventually sometime after an event he goes through you'll come to a decision where you get to select which mc you will play through the story as. Each girl has a different personality and unlike other female mcs in otome games they are voiced. After that you come to a selection of 3 guys. Each girl gets a different set of guys all with different looks and personalities. And of course there are several endings in which the MC can end up depending on their choices. This game has excellent voice actors (voices are in japanese), beautiful art, and wonderful music. Theres fun with trying to connect the whole story together with these multiple routes to play through.

(I recommend playing the Pink Hair Mc first and then choose Kakeru.)

Theres even a minigame where you can earn points to spend at the norn9 store to unlock ministories of the norn9 after you play and complete a route.

Complete all of the routes though for a surprise. This game is packed with hours if not days of content.

"I am fortunate in that I waited to get my download of this enhanced edition of BG I. I saw a number of initial reviews by folks that tried it when first released. It had many bugs and other issues. I hoped that by waiting a while a corrected copy would be released. I was not disappointed. The redo of this old RPG classic is excellent. I do not know if all the bugs have been worked out as I am only halfway through the regular BG game at this point. I have not had a single issue of any kind to this point.

I tried the Black Pits and liked it so much I ended up completing it before getting very far into the Original campaign. I really like the new interface with the BG II updates. The spell list from BG II is included and the spells now function the same in both. The PC kits from BG II were also backfitted and now you can take a character with one of those nice kits all the way through. The game also includes all the elements from Tales of the Swordcoast.

"I'm writing this review from the point of view of a casual gamer who only plays against the computer; I like being able to quit a game whenever I feel like it. So, obviously, I'll only be commenting on the single-player modes.

The campaign modes of the game features nothing from the movies proper, instead focusing on the ""War in the North"" - the Goblins versus the Elves and Dwarves. The campaign is comparatively short, featuring only about 1/3 of the missions of the original BFME, presented in a fixed order. However, the locales and actual missions are varied and well-designed, avoiding the monotony that was 75% of the BFME I campaigns (a.k.a. destroy the enemy base, which was always located directly opposite you on the map, and maybe fulfill the ridiculously easy secondary objective).

As you can tell from the campaigns, three new factions are introduced - Goblins (roughly equivalent to the spam-happy Mordor from BFME I - units that are weak but cheap with a few random heavy hitters), Dwarves (incredibly strong and ponderously slow, very good on the defensive), and Elves (think Gondor from BFME I and soup it up, making them stronger and faster but are slightly weaker defensively as a trade off). Gondor and Rohan have been combined into the ""Men of the West"" faction, combining the best of both worlds, and Mordor has been made slightly more robust, including adding a few more heroes, but have lost the free orcs. Isengard, with the exception of adding new heroes, is pretty much identical.

My favorite addition to the game is the ""War of the Ring"" mode, which takes the campaign mode from BFME I and turns it into a Risk type of game, with territories able to be reconquered, garrisoned, built up and more. This adds a great level of strategy and fun to the game, and any battles can be auto-resolved or fought out in real-time. My only complaints about this mode are that the AI tends to be too agressive, leaving their territories undefended, and that the players only can have three armies that invade other territories (they led by pre-selected heroes you have at the beginning of the game; later heroes you build can't lead armies).

The create-a-hero feature is a cool concept, but I would have liked to see more options - each character can only have certain skills depending on their class (wizard, orc, et cetera), which is fine, but we only get 12 or so to choose from. Appearance options are even worse, with only a sparse variety - you can't even change hair color. And every hero costs 2000 resources, no matter how powerful or useless they are. (This was apparently fixed in the now-difficult-to-find expansion pack, ""Rise of the Witch King"")

Also, a lot of the little annoying things from BFME I have been fixed. Unit-producing buildings now can be upgraded by purchasing an upgrade, cutting out the rank-based-on-production system that never worked because the command point limit was so low - another issue that has been resolved in BFME II, with a base CP limit of 1000 that is adjustable (it also is realistic - player start a game with 100 CPs and, as they build up their infrastructure, get more). Resource gathering is now based on territory and buildings can be built anywhere, which makes the game more realistic - factions now battle it out for the entire map instead of trying to control one of several arbitrarily-chosen ""expansion points."" There is also a new difficulty for the AI - ""Brutal"" - for those of us who found the ""Hard"" opponents somewhat lacking.

All in all, this is a very worthwhile game that is both deeper than BFME I (thereby pleasing the BFME and other RTS veterans) while still being fairly easy to pick up (meaning the rookies will enjoy it). It's quality and fun, but has enough frustrations and shortcomings to land it squarely in 4-star territory.",4.0,B000CA5FLW,A slightly more fleshed-out version of the original,Video Games

Also, you have to unlock many of the games, which I have yet to do so when you get the game you only have about 18 of the 30 games to play. The controls are sometimes difficult to operate and most of them involve the same motions. I played with 2 players and you play against 2 ""computer"" plays as well. The computer players were pretty good at the games and I'm not sure if you can change their levels. All the games are really short, 2 minutes or less and are timed.

"I really loved this game as a kid and I still am impressed... or did I mean depressed?  Hmm...  Well the graphics are beautiful, but this isn't exactly a game you would have your 5 year old play.  Oh no, this is some serious stuff!  The game play is extremely difficult, as others have said.  I think the difficulty just adds to the overall gloominess of the game.  All is hopeless.  You're stuck.  How could a game about a dolphin be so depressing you ask?  Well the game starts out with Ecco (the dolphin) swimming around the sea with his family.  The music is lovely and everything is perfect.  Then all of a sudden, some strange bizarre storm comes by and sweeps up his entire family.  Yep...  Ecco is all alone.  His family and friends are gone, the music has changed to some dreadful depressing music that is nothing less than a deep brooding despair.  You'll wander around the sea looking for your fellow dolphins and the pressing the button on your controller sends out a sound wave that in itself sounds like a eerie cry for help which always goes unanswered.

It's not long after this, that the actual game starts.  The music shifts again to a dark gloomy, but intense melody that perfectly sets the mood.  It is your mission to find out what has happened to your pod, while being attacked by other sea monsters that just want you dead.  Even touching a jellyfish can hurt you.  Oh, and you can't stay under water for too long without air or you drown.  Yes, this game is difficult and it's a challenge figuring out where you need to go in the maze of underground caves and trying to get through there before running out of oxygen.

Have I said how difficult this game is?  Let me put is this way, when you purchase this game, you may as well buy a few extra controllers, too, because no doubt, you'll toss a few against the wall.  Go ahead.  Put in your passwords, secret codes and plug in the game genie.  You won't be beating this game.

"Loaded up easily on my Lenovo Win 7 dual core.  The game had a problem recognizing my Thrustmaster 5-in-1 wheel thinking it was a Thrustmaster Challenge wheel that has different settings for operations such as braking and acceleration.  I clicked on file properties and went to the game file's location.  There I found another file for the English manual. On page 20, or so, it explains how to create a wheel profile for an unrecognized wheel.  All I had to do was go back to the game, choose the controls section, and then create a new profile as instructed.  Different operation boxes were shown, and I then steered the wheel, stepped on a pedal, or pressed a button to create the profile.

I am now up and running on the realistic (for beginners) Extreme Arcade section of the game. The car on the screen responds well to my wheel even though the wheel is a less expensive model.  I like that the game's graphics resemble a race track and countryside without artificial additions and craziness.

Another plus,  is the modifications that can be made to the game such as downloading Formula 1 cars from [...].  I purchased a membership for a small fee, so that the download took minutes rather than hours.  I also had to download an unzip file that I found for free on the Internet.  The instruction in the readme.txt file explains where to place the other downloaded files.  They are put in the Steam file loaded on the hard drive.  The instructions say that the downloaded files are going into Race 07, but the files are actually placed in both the Race 07 and the GTR Evolution games.  When I purchased GTR Evolution, I also also got Race 07. The games seem identical except for the intro music.  The 2005 Formula 1 cars that I downloaded have the catchy shrieking sound.  I access the Formula 1 cars by clicking on BMW formula.  I then have the option of both types of formula cars.  The Formula 1 cars' fragility and tendency to spin-out make the game all the more fun.

From what I've read this game doesn't require as much of a computer as Simbin's GTR2 but it is still a challenging simulation game. Simbin also has good support.

First a disclaimer as I bought my A50s directly from Astro as I had a very good discount code that Amazon couldn't match. Now on to the review. I have owned all 3 generations of the A50 headset and in my opinion they just keep getting better. This gen 3 model has slight cosmetic differences from gen 1 and gen 2 but overall feels pretty familiar. Felt identical to my others with one very nice but note able difference and that is the overall weight: Astro put these on a serious diet as they now feel as light as the A40s. This equates to a headset that is even more comfortable for extended periods of time which I didn't think was possible. Sound wise I notice that this new model sounds crisper in the mid and highs than the previous models. Mic quality out of the box is about the same but can be improved through the Astro Command Center.  Battery life is much better as I am getting about 15hrs out of the new model where 8 was about the best with the two previous models. If you already own a pair of A50s I'm not sure if the upgrade is worth it. My previous models would no longer hold a battery charge and I was tired of using them wired so I chose to do the upgrade.

"This has to be in the top 10 best video games ever made. Everything is absolutely perfect. Sure, some themes aren't right, but who cares. There are missing some people(nobody I really would want to play as, maybe except jamie noble and spike dudely.) There are over 55 superstars, a whole lot of arenas, and the best season mode ever seen in any kind of game. This also has the best create a wrestler ever in a wrestling game. The graphics are some of the best I have ever seen. ( the only games that I can think of off the top of my head that have better graphics are Kingdom Hearts, and a few other square enix games.) I don't think I have had this much fun playing a game since Mortal Kombat 2 in arcades. I love this game. I stayed up 3 days straight just playing this. I ate and stuff, but most of the time I played this. I invited 3 friends over and we agreed that we hadden't had so much fun playing a game multiplayer since Halo. Most of the time all we did was play Armeggedon Hell in a Cell. (Kind of like a fatal four way, except with six people. I'm not talking about elimination chamber.) It has all the match types that deserve to be in a game. The only one I can think of that isn't in this game is the coffin match, which was stupid anyway. When you do matches in season mode you get smackdown! dollars you can use to buy stuff. You can buy Legends, (Jimmy Superfly Snuka, Ted Dibiase, Sgt. Slaughter, Old School Undertaker, Road Warriors, (rest in piece, Hawk) and others.) You can buy arenas (Wrestlemania XIX, pay per view arenas, times square.) You can buy move sets, diva loading screens, extra costumes for certain wrestlers, and the ability to change the bra and panties color for certain divas. Now, onto the two new matches. The elimination chamber, and the bra and pamties match. Elimination chamber is one of the funnest matches in the game. It is like a hell in a cell, Except ther are four chambers behind the turnbuckles. With a wrestler waiting in each chamber. Two wrestlers start out battling in the ring, and after a few minutes, a wrestler is released from one of the chambers. When you pin or make somebody tap out, they are eliminated. All six superstars can be in the ring at the same time, making a really insane crazy match. Bra and panties is stupid, I think. You objective is to tear your opponents clothes off until they are left in their bra and panties. Not very fun. In the season mode you start right after wrestlemania and work your way towards next years wrestlemania. But you can only go one year. But if you save it, you can go through season mode again with that character and carry over everything you did the last season. So say you are HHH, and you win the World heavyweight championship. And you still have it after wrestlemania, than if you track everything, it will be on the next season that you do. You can also upgrade your stats as you go along. Each wrestlers has 5 different stats that you can upgrade. Strengh, speed, technique, submission, and stamina. You get experiance for every match you do in season. Get enough and you can upgrade one of your superstars stats. They also have weight detection. For instance, Rey Mysterio won't be able to pick up big show at first, but if you get his strengh stat up, eventually he will be able to.

"I LOVE THIS MOUSE!!! This is the single greatest gaming mouse I have ever had. The side buttons are easy to use and once you get used to the size of the mouse, they become just another part of your routine. Technically, this thing has 18 buttons:

We will start with the obvious 12 buttons on the side that you hit with your thumb. These buttons are handy for hotkeys in games and other programs. They don't replace the horizontal number buttons across the top of your keyboard but work in conjunction with them; making certain tasks much easier. I found out completely by accident the other day that the side numbers on the mouse work while watching youtube as well. press any button and you can jump around in the video. For instance - If you open a video and press 5, it will jump the cue mark ahead in the video. If you press 1 again, it will move that cue back to the beginning of the video.

Beyond those 12, we have the left and right click buttons along with the wheel in the center. Directly behind the wheel there are 2 little buttons that adjust the mouse's sensitivity allowing you the user to customize the way you interact with your computer. The last button, number 18 is directly to the left of the left mouse button. It is a tiny little button and can highlight an entire page of text without moving your mouse. Very nice feature to have handy.

UPDATE: Tomorrow (Dec. 3, 2016) will be 2 years since I ordered this mouse. I use it everyday. It is an absolute delight to use. I would give this thing 10 stars if I could. It is extremely comfortable in my hand. It works flawlessly on almost any surface I put it on (there are exceptions). After 2 years the lights are still as bright and vibrant as they were the day I plugged it in. I expected some wear and tear over time as I am an avid gamer and use this mouse in countless programs. Every button still works like the day it arrived. the DPI sensor still works like a charm.

Bottom line: This mouse, the ""UtechSmart Venus 16400 DPI High Precision Laser MMO Gaming Mouse"" is bomb-proof. I may buy one more just to have incase this one dies sometime in the next twenty years.",5.0,B00FNKMVUO,Mouse Technology Perfection,Video Games

"Conceptually, this game has an interesting premise: due to a rupture in the space-time continuum we have three popular warring classes fighting each other on the same continent consisting of knights, vikings, and samurais oh mai!  For Honor then tries to blend the complex combat style of Bloodborne with the epic battle scale of Battlefield and what we get is a hot mess of rock, paper, scissors combat descending into who gangs up on who contest.  Combine gameplay that nearly makes the game annoying with the fact that the game is DRM and is always required to be online and you get a game that is not worth it for any casual gamer.

Now, that's not to say For Honor doesn't have a single-player campaign to try and stand up on it's own.  The single player campaign consists of a three-part mini-series following several characters from each faction revolving around a revolution led by a character that admired Bri of Tarth from Game of Thrones way too much and adopted the same callsign as the Angel of Death in the Greek translation of the Bible.  This would make for an interesting story except we don't get to be with the characters long enough to care and you never see their faces so, for all we know, they're Jango Fett clones and this is some weird battle scenario in the Star Wars world of Camino.

I only got mostly into the viking campaign before I got bored of carrying the entire army that couldn't march in a straight line if you paid them in mead.  Like the Ramirez meme in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, you feel a sense of doing everything while your people sit back, pull up the lawn furniture, and watch.  Even Ryse: Son of Rome, a game that came out years earlier, had AI teammates that helped out on occasion.

After single player I attempted the multiplayer campaign and, unless you communicate well with your team to stick together, you're gonna get ganged up on real fast, cheap swept off a tall ledge and insta-killed.  I'm not a fan of multiplayer anyway so the was the final straw that made me turn the game off and put Ghost Recon: Wildlands back in.

"This follow up to Master of Orion added a lot in the way of new bells and whistles, but lost the flavor that made MOO so much fun ... the need to be very creative in star ship building and strategy to win many unique styles of game that cropped up.

In MOO2, the strategy to win is pretty much the same every game. Build up tech, build up fleets, run the enemy off the map. There are new diplomacy options, tech options, and ship building features, but these details, I thought, quickly burned themselves out. The later portion of the game becomes an almost endless cycle of starting new buildings and ships as you have more and more planets contributing to production, and that is a serious drawback to all of the Civ type games. You can spend a considerable amount of time doing nothing but acknowledging ""production complete"" messages at the start of each game turn.

Still, the game overall was fun, and by the time computers didn't have floppy drives to load the original MOO anymore, I was more or less stuck with MOO2 for my sci-fi fix. LOL As of the date of this review, you can actually buy both games for six dollars at stardock, in one package. That's a great deal, and evidently lets you get the ancient MOO game onto current computers.

"I read quite a few reviews before purchasing a gamepad. I haven't used one in probably 8 or 10 years but I recently went back to a simple 2D space combat game I used to enjoy and remember it was much better with a good gamepad than the keys on my laptop.

I stayed away from the poorly rated ""super cheap"" gamepads out there and when I saw the decent reviews for this one I hoped it would be a happy medium.

I can't imagine there are gamepads out there that feel ""cheaper"" than this. My biggest problem is the D pad, it seems to be a 4 way only directional pad, pressing a ""corner"" produces no movement in my game at all.

Worse, even when I simply press left or right I have to REALLY press HARD for it to take sometimes, it is not nearly as responsive as it needs to be.

"It's rare that I'd write a customer review. Usually I just let my blog do the talking (see Gameosaurus dot com). But I saw here that no one gave this game the lowest possible score, and I thought I'd right that wrong.

PE1 and, yes, even PE2 weave an interesting plot. The series could have ended with PE2 and it would have been fine like that. ""The 3rd Birthday,"" on the other hand, could have been a fantastic follow-up. There are dozens of different directions the creative leads at S-E could have taken this franchise, all of which would have been more interesting and more valid than what they did in this game.

The biggest offense of all: the usage of the Kill-Bill-esque ""wedding deathtrap"" with *NO EXPLANATION EVER GIVEN AS TO WHY IT HAPPENED.* This is the inciting incident that creates the entire plot arc, what with its convoluted plot twists and time loops and weirdly one-dimensional characters. They couldn't even throw it in as a bonus ending, or a secret file among Blank's emails. Just ... nothing.

I won't even touch on the other aspects of the game. Much of that is relative. Yes, I like the music. No, I generally wasn't impressed by the combat, though the concept of body-jacking is clever (and works very well in games like in Driver: SF).

"Seeing that the majority of reviews here are thanking Amazon for making the PS4 available for sale right before launch, and not actually reviewing the PS4, I decided that a review of the system should be posted up for those that are looking for real reviews.

I was one of the lucky ones who got a PS4 a few days earlier because of the Taco Bell promo, so I've had a few days prior to launch to mess around with it. I was able to get a copy of COD Ghosts, so please take that into account when I discuss the PS4 graphical capabilities. Also, I could not play online yet so I won't be talking about online gaming in this review.

The PS4 is Sony's 4th generation console, and they've been successful in every generation since their first. I think you're going to see history repeat itself with the PS4 launch...... off to a slow start, but by the end of the generation it will be on top. With a fairly weak lineup, there was honestly not much I was excited about, besides the fact that it's Sony's new console in 7 years. Hooking up the device is a breeze, you just plug the power cable (no power brick required!) into the PS4 and into the wall, and the HDMI (included) from the PS4 to your TV or receiver, and you're set to go. First thing I did was pop in COD Ghosts, installed it onto the HDD, and started playing the campaign mode. I have this game for the 360, and comparing the graphics to the PS4, it was only marginally better. The game looks very pretty, don't get me wrong, but it just isn't that big of a jump in graphical power from last generation to this generation (nothing like how when the Sega Dreamcast first came out and blew everything out of the water). Now for the game play itself...... there was some lag during some of the more intense parts of the game. The 360 version definitely handles COD better than the PS4, which makes sense because the PS4 is a brand new system, but then again, it is using an x86 architecture which is theoretically ""easier to program"" for, but I guess they had some trouble porting COD Ghosts.

Now let's talk about media capabilities, or lack thereof. Blu-Ray movies play fine, just as you would expect from Sony, however...you cannot play 3D movies! Sony will probably enable this feature later, but for now you can't do it. The PS4 is a 4K capable device, but only for movies and photos, not video games. One of my biggest gripes about the PS4 is that it can't play audio CDs and mp3s, or stream media from your computer....WTF Sony? The PS3 was a great media center, and I hoped the PS4 would be too, but these lack of basic music features is going to make me knock one star off of my rating. I've heard rumors that Sony will enable this feature later, but we will have to wait and see. I wouldn't be surprised if they pulled a 180 like Microsoft did earlier this year.

Pros:
-sleek product ID (smaller than the ps3 slim!)
-quiet design
-500 GB Hard Drive
-Ability to upgrade your HDD to a larger HDD (or SSD)
-controller is a Dualshock 3 on steroids (it's better in everyday)
-built in power supply (no brick!!!)
-USB 3.0 ports
-iPhone and Android app

Cons
-No Audio CD playback
-No MP3 playback
-No DLNA support
-No media streaming from a computer (no mp3s, no movies...)

"I live or die for basketball video games. I think I've probably had every single basketball video game known to man since even the Atari days. A lot has changed for sure.  When 2K blew us away with the first 2K game on the Dreamcast, I knew this franchise had a nice future ahead of it as long as they did what they did best, make the gameplay on the court solid. That's what makes these games. Bugs and glitches are part of this franchise, yeah, it's typical. More on those later.  I thought with 14 and 15 they let us down a bit and was one of the weaker 2K games. Legends got downgraded and what the heck happened to their faces??? 16 they got a little redemption and the gameplay got much better. 16 overall was a great complete package and kept me busy till I knew 17 was coming. If you downloaded the 2k17 Prelude, you know you're in for some greatness and 2k17 hasn't disappointed me aside from a few hiccups. 17, while not perfect, is probably the best playing 2K I've ever experienced. Read on.

The Prelude was available for you to play before 2k17 was launched. It basically teased you to buy the game and it did work! LOL. The game let's you start your ""My Career"" mode and prepare yourself to make it to the NBA. It really got me interested in the game more. While the gameplay was limited for what I played, I was really wanting to get the full game and finish my career after I finished the prelude.

NBA 2K17 has the usual offerings as you expect. The Prelude got me super interested in the career mode, and that's saying a lot, I usually just stick with GM mode and work with my team, not a single guy. But this mode is going to be a blast trying to get my player into the NBA.

On the court NBA 2k17 is superb. I'd say the controls and gameplay feel a lot better than 2k16. Shooting jumpers and the mechanics was a complaint for 2k16 by many and it looks like they ironed that out in 2k17. I love the new shooting meter (if you want it on) IF you have an open shot, and if you're a shooter, you'll swish these shots in no time! Rebounding, the touch passes look amazing and the fancy passes, while sweet in 16, look even more incredible than ever.  17 just feels more organic and you feel like you're more in control. There's some sweet new post moves also ,but they can't be explained by vocabulary, you'll just have to see them for yourself and you will. Dunking, the emotion, it's all here and yes, this feels like a real NBA game. Defensively is my only main complaint in this game. The aggressive D doesn't seem to be as helpful as I was hoping. I have guys running around me left and right. Thankfully, the Help D seems more in sync than last year. And that point of emphasis really seems to finally be working. I'd recommend if you have trouble guarding a guy at the point, I'd say control a guy in the paint and rely on your inside D. I still have guys leaving their man when I made no attempt or pressed for a double team, this was a bit of a problem on 16, and it seems to still happen on 17, but it's hit and miss.

The graphics are great overall. I'd say the courts look better than last year, not breathtaking, but very good. They promised real authentic lighting, although I heard some venues are inaccurate like LA and NY are not authentic for what we see now.  Speaking of the Knicks, the baby blue colors is still way off from the real court. Does MGS have a lock on what a game can show maybe? I wonder if it's just off for that reason? The knicks is NOT baby blue! I'll research that later.

In contrast of past games,  I still think 2k14 had the best looking courts and players, but 2k17 is no slouch. If this game took any cutback in the visuals, the player models skin looks like clay at times and some of the players might be too skinny. It's very subtle, and most won't really notice unless you're really giving them a good inspection, but if you compare to like NBA 2k14, you will notice the skin and proportions just looks slightly off. But what they did focus on, was the smooth animations and the player physique and proportions and the face scans are A grade with a few exceptions. When I checked out some of the faces, I was floored. I look at say a 98 Rodman of the Bulls. Wow, just google around for that one. You talk virtual reality, some of these faces will blow you away. The current guys probably look just as good. Durant's body finally looks like Durant's body, perhaps a bit too skinny and guys like Green on Warriors is distinguishable If your favorite player has a long wing span and long lanky arms, you're going to notice him next to a 250 pound Power forward.

The Legends are still there but I am disappointed for Kobe as isn't this the coverboy?  While he may be on the game and looks fantastic on the 98 lakers and the 01 Lakers, and on the cover and what not, I would have love to see some more Laker love. More teams would have been nice. But I don't see anything. Maybe they're planning some future DLC?  And in general, I didn't notice any new teams for the Legends lineup unfortunately. Still got the classic Bulls, Lakers, Spurs, Celtics, etc. I'll take those for now. But please, how bout bringing back the 2002 kings and 96 Pacers for next year please? :)  What I did see is that you can download (I think 12 college teams of the past with their all time players ) Teams like Georgetown, Kansas, Michigan State, etc. It's pretty cool you can download these additional teams, but it's a bit odd having them play NBA teams. These are college kids. lol. I wish we had a mini season we can do with these teams. Maybe we implement them into a customized franchise. I know you can use the past NBA teams in an NBA season, so maybe you can do that. Again, it's a bit weird. FYI, it's 14.99 to download all the NCAA teams available.

The last few years, fans have really been complaining on the look of the Legends and just being off, usually the complaints are because of their faces and hair looking ""not like their actual counterparts"". I thought they looked just okay in NBA 16. You'll have that great looking Legend, then find a Legend that looks downright bad. Jordan has been off for years. When they made the transition to next gen, something happened. Jordan looks a little better this year and some guys like Rodman, Ewing, Pippen, Bird, look absolutely fantastic this year and looks like virtual reality for some. And thankfully Steve Kerr no longer looks like a Ken Doll. The fans look a little bit more animated, but, eh. Still look like zombies when you see them up close. They show a little more animation and a bit more lively. But up close when you see them, they really don't look that much different from 2k16 or even 15 for that matter.

Out of the box, you get the Dream Team. Wahoo! Barkley finally signed. It's too bad we don't have a team like the 76ers or the Suns when Barkley was with them, but having the Dreamteam back again is amazing. Arguably the best basketball team ever made!!!

2K advertised authentic arena sounds and chants. In a nutshell, I'd say, yes, it's better than 2k17. But do NOT expect anything mind-blowingly awesome. They still use that generic PA announcer. You'll recognize him. He's been in the game since 2k9! I don't mind him, but man, wouldn't it be nice to have an authentic PA announcer for each venue? The crowd noise is better, not great, just better. Seems to be a little more interaction and emotion with things going on with the action. More cheers and more boos. It does add to the immersion. I need to play at some more venues around the league to determine if the chants and stadium sounds are truly authentic.

The game boasts 10 different commentators. I've only heard one different one in my play time so far, I think I ran into the usual, Kevin Harlan and I think the other guy was Brent Barry. Depending on where you play, you'll get a different guy along side with Harlan. It's pretty cool. Not sure how deep the commentary is, but we shall see. The halftime show is still Shaq, Kenny and Ernie. Ehhh. You'd think with Barkley being on the Dreamteam they could get him to be in the halftime. Nope. Darn it.

Update: After a few days I can talk a little more about My Career. It's awesome. You take your college phenom into the NBA and try to turn him into an NBA great. You get drafted to a random team and it takes you through an interesting story and the set pieces they put you in a great fantasy world of trying to make it as a pro in the NBA. The story I'd expect to be cheese all the way, but I was genuinely interested on what each day would bring. Coaches will send you texts and let you know how you're doing and give you some guidance and even a little love!  The first day I got drafted, I met with one of my rookie teammates and we played a game of 2k in the apartment. You can play pickup games with your team mates at the practice stadium or at your what I would call a ""crib"". You get a text messages from friends, coaches and even your mom. The texting thing is more fun to use than I thought and it keeps the game fresh. Leveling up to get your attributes seems to take a bit longer than it should however. And the pickup games with my friends/teammates doesnt' seem to give me any points/coins to gain. Maybe I'll get rewards later? Either way, it's a long process getting your guy solid. AS a standout draft pick, You' think your player would be higher than 55-57 overall. To me, we should be at least a 70. But ya know, the fun is leveling up. You get your most points playing real games. The game is different experience controlling one guy on the court. Sometimes I feel my team mates need to get me more involved. But overall, the AI is pretty good about getting me the ball. The mode will keep you busy all year.

I had a few glitches of blue screens obliterating the screen where I couldn't see the action until the moment of tip off. Glitchy! Happened a few times. No major glitches though where I had to reset. I've become accustomed to glitches for these games. I think they're rushed a bit. But usually the most obvious are taken care of. I hope.

NBA 2K17 continues to be the best sports franchise on the planet and 17 on the court is real basketball at its finest. Better than FIFA, better then Madden, better than NHL and of course better than NBA Live. There's a lot of love put into these games and while I'm sure we'll have those initial launch bugs of ""hey what's this bug about?"" It's just something we have to deal with. But hopefully with time, this game will keep you quite busy until 2k18.

"I know in the gaming world, people get touchy about absolutes, but this might be the best standard controller in the gaming world.  Microsoft landed on a well-sized controller with the Xbox 360 as the original Xbox had a very large controller (The Duke) as well as the S model, which was much smaller.  The Xbox One controller takes the 360 controller and refines the formula even more.  Recently, they updated that formula AGAIN, adding a 3.5mm headphone jack so you wouldn't need to use proprietary headsets or adapters any longer.  The press material states that the D-Pad and sticks have been redesigned, but they seem the same as the previous Xbox One controllers, so maybe they mean they were redesigned over the 360 controllers?  Am I missing something?

The included wireless dongle comes with Windows 10 drivers preinstalled, but it can be used with many versions of Windows.  Initially, you needed a separate USB cable to use the controller with Windows, and had to leave it plugged in, but the dongle allows for wireless play.

My only big complaint here is that the home button, or guide button, is VERY bright.  I haven't seen settings to change the brightness, but Microsoft has occasionally updated the firmware on the actual controllers.

Announced today, on the Xbox One, you can remap any of the buttons, similar to the Xbox Elite controller.  A nice feature for many gamers, and nice that they are continuing to improve this already great controller.",5.0,B015IX3X3E,"Great controller, made even more flexible",Video Games

"Microids Dracula 3: Path of the Dragon is the sequel to its two earlier games&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Microids-Dracula-1-2-DJC/dp/B0017HIH78/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Microids: Dracula 1 & 2 DJC</a>. The protagonist is Father Arno Moriani, a priest sent by the Vatican to investigate a local Transylvanian doctor who is slated for sainthood. But his seemingly simple investigation into the good doctor takes several unpredictable twists, and he soon finds himself plunged headfirst into a world of shadowy vampires, a battle that threatens not only his faith but also his life.

The main failing of the game is the *absence* of vampires; you only deal directly with the title character at the very end of a long and tiring journey. The rest of the time, you're researching obscure texts, closely examining artwork, and leafing through hefty tomes of Romanian history that deal with the origins of Dracula, or Vlad Tepes. There are also undercurrents of WWII even though the game is set in 1920 (yep, evil Nazis and bad German accents!). There are only a handful of characters, but the ones you do interact with are generally fleshed out, with unique personalities and solid voicework.

The puzzles themselves are some of the better ones I've seen in the last few years; there's a wide variety of strategy board games, locks, word puzzles, and inventory-based puzzles. Phlebotomy takes up a large part of the game; if you're squeamish, you probably won't go for the graphic how-to on drawing your own blood several times (""now all that's left is to push the needle deep into the vein!""), or poring over cells under a microscope.  Generally, the solutions are quite obvious, although one of the end puzzles requires careful observation and piecing together clues collected throughout the game. One of the features which could have been better utilized was the Bible passages; whenever your character is stressed out (you'll hear his heart beating loudly), you can flip open the Bible to an underlined passage that is directly related to the situation at hand. This action isn't necessary, however, and could have been made a more central element directly related to protecting Father Arno's faith (and sanity).

The graphics are lushly drawn, bringing to life the war-torn village with its bombed-out  buildings. Ghostly howls ricochet down the empty streets. The lushness of Budapest is a direct contrast to war-ravaged Romania, and you visit rural Turkey as well. Character animations are effective, and the cutscenes are downright gorgeous, with a hazy, dreamlike quality (you're able to replay videos through the gallery feature on the main menu). The only disappointment was the ending; after so many hours of research and daring escapes, the final confrontation was brief and disappointing. The end cinematics were great, though, and leave openings for future installments.  Overall, this is a solidly crafted adventure with loads of atmosphere and political intrigue, but sadly, little of the title character.",4.0,B001AH7VZE,"Lots of atmosphere, but low on vampires",Video Games

"As with Flying Wild Hogs previous title, Hard Reset (great, 4/5) SHADOW WARRIOR is a whole lot of riotous fun. Like its predecessor, its an old-school shooter, but with SW we get the added fun of melee combat. And thats basically what SW is all about: katana mayhem. It also shares much of the mechanics and gameplay tropes of the earlier game, and thats all to the good as well. It differs from Hard Reset in some areas, however, most notably with the variety of weapons and the more conventional upgrade system and skills tree. Theres also a stronger story, although it is a tad incoherent at times. There are some very cool cutscenes, but they're used sparsely and never intrude but do help to flesh out the story. And theres also plenty of amusing, deliberately cheesy, dialogue to enjoy. Graphically, SW is one of the most stunning games Ive come across, and it also delivers some impressive physics. Its not open world, as is de rigueur these days, but its linearity keeps the story, and the game progression, on the rails and never detracts from the fun.

"This game is a great port of the original. Here is how I rate the game in the following catagories:

3D Effect- C-
I played the game 95% of the time with it off. While it looked good most of the time there was way too much ghosting on certain images. They really needed to spend the time to get this part of it right with it being a launch game. I feel like this was a missed opportunity as this game was a perfect candidate to showcase the 3D capabilities of the 3DS. Compared to Pilotwings Resort this is a big fail.

Controls- B-
The camera, when locked in the normal position, focused too much on the ground. I always felt like I wanted to lift my head up the whole time. I was never really able to get used to it. I found myself wanting to go into 1st person view a lot to compensate which is not really necessary but becuase of the camera it made it feel like a need. Other than that the other controls worked perfectly.

Sound- D
The sound was the biggest problem with this game. It sounded like crackling through the speakers a lot. Like they were going to blow. And, keep in mind, the volume was never very loud. This was definately a programing problem.

Graphics- B+
The game is quite gorgeous to look at. It has aged well and is ported in a respectful manner here. Even to todays standards this game looks very nice indeed.

Fun- B+
I really enjoyed this game back in the day and it is just as fun now. Like I mentioned already, this game does not seem like it has aged at all.

Overall, I really enjoyed this game. It is a very fun game. Apart from the camera and sound the game is of high standards even in terms of current day games.

Update: After 1 year 6 months of purchasing our console, we are still very happy with the purchase. This bundle is worth every penny. We use it all the time, for playing games, not only Titanfall, we also play Diablo ROS among others. We never had any issues with the system or the hardware. My favorite feature is the kinect, that makes everthing so simple with the voice commands, being able to record a portion of your game, make screenshots, turn on or off your console. Opening apps like Hulu and Netflix with voice commands as well, it is all just great.

"This should be a happy time for Ann - she's finally gotten over the disappearance of her little brother Tommy years ago and become engaged to Henry.

""Lake House: Children of Silence"" is a nicely done hidden object/adventure game.  There are two levels of playing: casual (with a hint button that refreshes after 30 seconds and the interactive areas sparkle) and expert (with a hint button that refreshes after two minutes and there is no interactive help).  I played it in casual mode as I like to relax while playing games.  The animation is so-so at the beginning of the game but gets better as the game goes along.  The storyline is a great one and held my interest throughout.  The game is a nice mixture of puzzles and hidden object games.  The puzzles were challenging but not too difficult.  The hidden object games are nicely done - sometimes you have to move something or put something together to find the object.  There is a map - not the best map I've seen in games like this but it is very handy in letting you know which locations you can work on.  The music is a nice background for the game.  The game itself has just the right amount of creepiness without being too scary.

"If you are a fan of the need for speed series, be aware, there are better games than this one.
Let's make it simple, when it comes to the visuals, it certainly looks better than NSF Undercover but, anything does. NFS hot pursuit, NFS unleashed 1 and 2 look better. When it comes to the performance, the cars still feel like they are running with the emergency brake on; in that regard hot pursuit and Unleashed perform better. Besides that, there is the story or career which I think in an arcade racer it's pointless. It does not matter which ""star"" from whatever show is in it, it is a race get from point A to point B in a pre-determined time.

what you get for your money:
short game play.
cheap resets.
rubber band AI.

If you want to have a lot of fun with a racing game, you are better off getting hot pursuit than getting this one. Rent if possible, do not buy, if you do disappointment awaits.

"Halo Wars for the Xbox 360 is a lot like what&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Battle-for-Middle-Earth/dp/B00026ENLE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-Earth</a>&nbsp;was for the PC. Both took a franchise that was very popular and turned it into a real-time strategy that was very simplistic but surprisingly fun, thus making it a gateway game for people who had never tried a strategy game before.

Like BFME, Halo Wars offers the bare minimum of customization: bases are in fixed locations on the map, there are three basic types of units, and only one kind of resource. Without all the fixin's that us RTS vets are used to, though, this game is very intuitive, and even players who have never touched a strategy game in their life will have the hang of it within the first few missions of the campaign (which is excellent, by the way, but only playable on the UNSC side - you only play the Covenant in skirmish mode). The graphics in the game are also superb, comparable to BFME II played on the good graphics settings.

The game has the standard 1000G available from Achievements, but spreads them out a lot. Each mission has a 5G Achievement attached to it. Sort of making up for that, you get five Achievements worth 250G (and a pair of gamer pictures) just from beating the campaign on any difficulty, two of them worth a whopping 70G apiece. Another 80G (and maybe more gamer pictures - haven't tried to get them yet) await those who beat the game on Hard (30G) and Legendary (50G) as well.

A few things about the game did tick me off. Grouping units is nonexistent, and specialized selection is nearly absent - you can select individual units, a series of individual units, all units of one type, all in a general area, all on-screen, or all overall. This made planning multi-front assaults hard to execute (the ""all in a general area"" selection option did not always grab every unit in an area, and sometimes grabbed a separate unit that was near a clustered group that it could probably have been on-screen if the screen was aligned just so). There is a nice ""Automatic"" difficulty option in Skirmish mode, but it gets very hard very quickly (I went from a breezy 40 to a decent 60 to a hair-pulling 97 in three matches). Finally, when you play as the Covenant (or against them), you really have to look at your buildings to tell them apart. I still click on the building to see what it is. Thankfully, all the UNSC buildings look different enough that you can see what they are at a glance.

Halo Wars is a good entry-level RTS, made even more impressive by the fact that it's on a console. Don't play this game looking for strategic depth, but it's a blast to play or watch being played.",4.0,B0017HW5LM,A surprisingly good Halo RTS,Video Games

"This is a great game and it's an addictive RPG. The trio its in (Gold, Silver, and Crystal) are often thought to be the best Pokemon games, pre-HGSS at least. I can't agree on that, but they're still fantastic. I can't think of a single bad thing about this game, though it may be odd if you're used to the newer titles.

You can only play as Ethan. So if you're used to the gender option, too bad. That wasn't implemented until Crystal, the next game.

There isn't much of a difference between Gold and Silver. It mainly depends on what Pokemon you want, and whether you want Lugia or Ho-Oh on your cart and title screen.

Gold's exclusive Pokemon are: Mankey, Primeape, Growlithe, Arcanine, Spinarak, Ariados, Gligar, Mantine.
Silver's are: Vulpix, Ninetales, Meowth, Persian, Ledyba, Ledian, Delibird, Skarmory

Pros:
When gaming I found that it tracked and targeted well.
Right and left buttons are easy to press.
Scroll wheel feels sturdy and it scrolls smoothly.
It is a nice size--not too large and clunky, but not uncomfortably small--and it also has a smooth finish which is pleasant.
It is lightweight, but still well balanced.

Installed to my computer without software.

Cons:
No extra buttons.
Shorter cable than I need, but that is a common problem. I have only encountered a few with a long enough cable.
I can't help but feel that $40 is a bit pricey for such a simple, no frills mouse.

I received a free mouse for review and it did not contain the software, so if there are any special, customizable features I can not review them.

I also have yet to drop it (give me a few more hours), so I can't contest to it's sturdiness.  I will update this review if I find that a problem.

Overall, if looking to invest around $40 for a two-button gaming mouse, I would recommend this one.

Edit: I have to change my opinion on this mouse.  I have used it (a lot) for the past six days.  I have also dropped it a few times.  The cursor is now jerky at times, jittering all around what I am trying to click on.  This doesn't happen constantly, but it is does happen in both gaming and when surfing.

"How many of you remember the SNES slasher Soulblazer? Well, add improved graphics, weapons upgrades, and more control over the placement of town parts, and that's what you got. I will give the game its certain due, though. It borrowed the fishing mini-game found in the Breath of Fire series. A very fun distraction. The repetative dungeon crawl does become addictive as you attempt to gather gems, stones, and experience to convert your weapons, though I actually dozed off in 'Shipwreck', and when I shook myself awake I had completed another couple of levels... HOWEVER, the game does have redeeming factors. One, the graphics are okay+. Game control is very good. I do like the need to repair weapons as well as upgrade and transmute them. DC is the next best thing after Onimusha to come out on PS2. Don't get me wrong, I'm a die hard Sony guy, but they really needed a hit prior to the upcoming Dark Angel. Due to it's length, Dark Cloud is NOT a rental unless you get one of those 5 day specials and have 10 hours each day to dedicate. And this game DOES eat up time.

"Never really got into these battle card games, but this is different. No big caluations, no need for a calulator and no need to strain your memory memorising your monsters HP.

Whilst one review didn't like the cotton mat, it is quite good quality and better than using another mterial such as paper (as some of these card games do). The graphics are very impressive and the animations are smooth. You can turn the animations of if you so wish.

You don't even need a controller for this game (expect for the menus) and the main game can be played with just cards - which is really cool and convient. The 'action cards' need to be held up to the eye which is a knack as you must get it the right distance from the eye and whithout obsuring the face of the card.

I personally don't mind the metal soundtrack it seems to suit the game (but when defeat is near - I hate it!). When the game starts to get a bit crowded (with lots of cards on the mat) there is often a problem with one card not being read properly - you fix that and in doing so, you ruin another card etc. Shadows are the main cause of this (so buy/get a desktop lamp or something!).

The game allows you focus on the great stratgry element - but the tutrials are more cofusing than they are helpful. Play with a friend the first few times and learn from each others mistakes - before challanging a computer or going online. The cards themselves are good quality and with currently over 110 crds to collect (with more on there way) the game always give you soemthing new.

"Okay, first let me tell you something before I begin. This was my first Zelda game, and I was very impressed with it. I later bought Oracle of Ages, and I can tell you quite honestly that this is the better of the two.
There are many things that give this game an advantage over Ages. To me, this was as good an introduction to the entire Zelda saga as I could have imagined, although the very first one probably would have been helpful too :). Anyways, I found that everything in this game was easy to understand and to follow, and I picked up on the gameplay very quickly. If I had started with Ages, I would have been left in the dark and become discouraged.
The people are much nicer to talk to in Seasons, and that makes it easier, knowing that going up to someone in the game, you will probably get a kind response. Not so in Ages, as some (maybe even most) of the people are surly in response, which I did not find very appealing.
One of the most blatant benefits of the game is that there are four different variations to each tile, Spring, Summer, Fall, and Winter, whereas there is only Past and Present in Ages.

"I've been a happy 360 Elite owner for two years and decided to get the new 250GB Slim model for the bigger storage space and internal wireless. Unfortunately, I didn't realize that I needed to spend an additional $25 for the official Microsoft component input cable, specifically, the one with the switch that lets you use the component input cable with a standard def or an HD television. I have a 32"" standard def Panasonic with component inputs, and the monster cable I got didn't have the switch, and didn't work with my Slim + Standard Def tv.

Also, the antenna for the internal wireless doesn't seem very strong. I previously used the official wireless N dongle with the dual antenna and got great reception, but the Slim only gets one red bar of reception in the same location. Very disappointed.

Follow Up: I plugged my official external Wireless N antenna into the new 360 Slim and got WAY better wireless reception.

"Since I have the older first Mortal Kombat  game running on my gaming system under the DosBox, I was interested to see what the new release was like. First, I must admit, I have never really been very good at the older game, and since it required a ""password"" from the original game manual to get into the game, I've played it very little. Anyway, I noted this was a Steam game and I have a number of them and they run fairly well on my system since I have broadband so it's not a big problem for me. (The download and installation are the biggest hassles so far.) At any rate, like I said, I've play the old game and now this new one and I must admit, I like the new one better. Even though, I have a lot of trouble getting the combos to work for me as, being older, I'm just not as fast as I used to be, this game is fun to play. I haven't really ""dug deep"" into it yet as I've been working with the learning part, but it's a lot of fun. Even though I doubt I'll get to be very good at it, I think I'll have a lot of fun. I'm playing it using a Xbox 360 gamepad and it sure makes it easier to play. On the older game you could use a mouse KB or a joystick, but the gamepad is so much easier. At any rate, well worth a look!",5.0,B00D02ARRQ,Not To Bad...,Video Games
"I was one of the lucky few... ok a bunch of people who ""pre-ordered"" this from best buy, I got the shirt. I got it, and read reviews about it, and the reviews were mixed; but since i loved the driver series, except for its insane difficulty. I wanted to give this game a go, at first i liked it.... this is how the game basically went for me I would play and be like this is sweet, coolness replays make me laugh when i screwed up, i replayed and replayed. and along the way i would drop numerous ""F bombs,"" and ""MF's"" and an insane amount of ""thats F*ing bs."" I actually quite liked it, i just needed to take breaks between play so i would get an anurism in my brain. The unique style of gameplay, although super frustrating, had endings of sequences that were extremely satisfactory. Watching the tralers of the movies with your stunts in the trailer was an incredible idea, I kept saying to my mom, and friends, ""check this out, thats me! i did that! :D :D"" the game filled me with glee everytime i beat something insanely hard.
3 things about the game made me want to stop playing, many times, the super annoying director guys voice; and the horrible Frames Per Second, and gittery car physics. I swear the FPS in the game would never get above 50, at most; and when stuff was flying all over the screen forget about it, it was like watching a slow-motion replay. the guys voice was so annoying, ugh.. take 1, take 2, take 3. ROLLING, i wish he would just be quiet if he knew what was good for him. Sometimes i would hit his cameras on purpose. hah.
Car physics gets its own new paragraph, cause they were simply put; MOON GRAVITY PHYSICS. Truly, the cars would hit a curb and bounce up in the air, or on the final level, smash curb and flip over; in a lamborghini yeah... right. I kept telling myself the gravity was like that so you could get air-born for the stunts. But a little bit of tweaking, would have made this game so much more playable and not throw controller down frustrating.
I end this with the fact that i beat the game on Friday, 2 nights ago, well... saturday morning. I really enjoyed the game, the replays were great, and i actually felt like i accomplished something great when i was done. not too mention that i can play all the missions again, for a few kicks. and forcing my sister to beat it makes her better at other driving games.",4.0,B0000631WI,"Hard as sin, choppy gameplay, but somehow very rewarding",Video Games

"Rockstar is perhaps most well known for their Grand Theft Auto series, of which I have never been a fan. Players of that series will find familiar controls and story-telling techniques. Red Dead Redemption however takes place in the wild west. The main character used to run with a gang of banditos that are some of the most feared and respected desperadoes around, but means to turn over a new leaf and task one is bringing his former allies to justice.

The Game of the Year Edition is the only edition to consider buying. Right now it is no more costly than previous versions and comes with all the DLC add ons, including the Nightmare stand alone expansion. Mixing zombies and the wild west might sound like a strange concept but it gets pulled off exceptionally well.

The game has a ton of content and is an excellent value that will keep you playing well over 100 hours if you wish to get all the achievements. There's also gambling, hunting, foraging, online challenges and leaderboards and so much more. The Xbox 360 version also has unlockables for your avatar.

"I bought this game because of reviews I read on here. I was delighted to find it very entertaining. The latter levels near the end are a bit frustrating as you have to kill the bad guys and they are very hard to kill, while you aren't... But, it was still a lot of fun once I figured out how to play the game. The only real drawback I see in this game is the saves. You can quick save or save the game at any point. But, when you try to load the game, you always start at the beginning of the level and have to work your way back up to the spot you saved at. That can be a bit annoying... Still, I'd recommend this game to gamers. I LOVE FPS and this one was interesting and the cartoon art was excellent. The saves annoyed me because I tried to save after certain lengthy cut-scenes only to learn that the save was essentially worthless. I had to go through it all over again... I look forward to the follow-up to this game. I think most gamers would like this game...

"Holding the unit my fingers tend to rest on the rear touch panel. This hasn't really been an issue too much, but in games like little deviants where you are using the back panel to push up from underneath your other hand can accidentally be pushing the touch pad in the wrong spot. There are two little divots that seem to be where your fingers are supposed to go, but I have fairly large hands and it is not comfortable keeping my fingers there. The system itself is pretty light, but feels solid in your hands. The front and back both have glass so getting two screen protectors might be prudent and a hard case for travel wouldn't be unwise.

The sound is much better then you could get out of the PSP and the speaker placement has never been an issue, even with my large hands. I could still clearly hear dialog in games in noisy environments and people were even commenting on how good the Vita sounded.

The screen is a thing of beauty. It is 5' and the colors and brightness are amazing, with one small exception. You don't want to play your system in a completely dark room if you can help it. This might sound weird, but the screen has these dark ""spots"" that show up when the system is displaying a black screen in a completely dark room. If you turn on a light it is impossible to find these spots and the screen is amazing again. The manual says this is normal and not a malfunction of the Vita system, and I've heard from users of OLED phones that they've seen similar on their screens in perfectly dark rooms with a perfectly black image on the screen. Even when you see it, it's not horrible, and during 99% of game play you can't even notice this effect.

The touch screen function of the screen seems to be less sensitive than an iphone or android phone, but it works for the games and demos I've played on the system. The only time you really notice the lack of precision is when using the web browser and trying to touch a small link (you'll need to zoom in most of the time). Using it to throw grenades in Uncharted adds a precision that really adds to the game, so I hope other games come up with other control adaptations for the touch screen that add instead of take away from the experience.

Moving on to the web browser...well maybe we don't want to talk about that so much. Imagine the PSP browser with touch controls. Are you done retching yet? Sorry to say this is pretty much what you get. Some websites show a mobile version, others don't unless you specifically type the mobile address into the browser. Flash is not supported (Sony asked Adobe to support flash on the Vita but I don't know if they'll do it after announcing they don't want to support mobile flash anymore), so websites that use it don't work. Trying to access YouTube videos results in an error that you need to install flash in the browser. Some websites are just broken in areas (Facebook for example was constantly messing up on the Vita's browser). It is weird that Facebook has so much trouble working with the browser, but you can setup the system to automatically post to Facebook with your trophy accomplishments.

There are two cameras on the Vita. They are not the type of cameras you'll want to use for taking every day pictures. They are only .3 megapixel (same as the 3DS, however the 3DS cameras seems to take ever so slightly clearer pictures) which compared to even a basic phone is pretty awful. I don't think anyone planned to use the systems cameras for very much, so this shouldn't be too big of a deal breaker.

Games are put in by opening a flap on the top of the system. I've read some sites saying you might need a screwdriver to open this, and that is just wrong unless you don't have any fingernails. I have no trouble at all opening and closing the flap to put in and take out games.

One great feature of the system is the ability to take screenshots while playing. Simply hold start and push the PS button and the screenshot gets saved to your memory card. I wish more systems had this feature, I've been using it a lot more than I thought I would.

The start, select, and PS buttons are flush with the system which makes it really hard to accidentally press them which is great. The buttons are smaller than they are on the PSP, but they have a click to them which is much more satisfying than using the PSP buttons. The d-pad feels spot on, and fighting games should have no problem with it. The two analog sticks are okay, but they could be better. They can't be pushed to be used as L3 or R3 like on PS3, and they have a pretty limited range of motion. They get the job done, and I rate them higher than the circle pad on 3DS, but they are not as great as the stick you'd get on a 360 or PS3 controller.

Charging the system is done through an included proprietary USB cable. It's sad that Sony took a step back from the PSP when it comes to the USB connection, being able to use the same cable to connect my dual shock 3 and PSP was great. Now if your Vita cable breaks you'll be looking for a Vita specific cable. It can be hooked up to a PC to charge while powered off (very slow) or there is a power cable that the USB can be connected to which charges it at a much faster rate (and it can charges while powered on).

The memory for the Vita is also proprietary (and expensive, thanks Sony) and Sony added a layer of protection which makes using them a much bigger pain then memory was on the PSP. Your memory card is now attached to your PSN ID, and so is your Vita. In order to download something from another PSN ID (such as a JP or HK PSN account) you'll need to format your system, set up the system from start with the new PSN ID, then install a memory card attached to that PSN ID or reformat the memory card. To put it plainly it is a pain in the butt.

Speaking of pain in the butt, transferring files to and from the vita is not as easy as the PSP, and this feature also took a step backwards. You now have to access the media manager on the Vita and use it to transfer files to and from the system. Gone are the days of telling your PS3 to install something to the USB attached system or dragging and dropping files from your PC. You still cannot arrange your files on the Vita (like the PSP) without changing their name because the system automatically sorts by alphabetical order and that seems to be it.

The replacement for the XMB is a multitasking touch screen interface on the vita, and it is an improvement overall. Everything is separated into little bubbles and touching one launches the content. You can swipe to the sides to swap between tasks running in the background (when not in a game) and the whole thing is very fluid and easy to learn very quickly.

The system also comes with some little mini games (you can get trophies in them!) which are fun for about a minute each after you first get the system, then you'll never touch them again. They are part of the Welcome Park application, and they are designed to show off that the system has a touch screen, cameras, etc...

My final verdict on the system is colored by the games I've played and hope to play in the future. The system does have its issues (several of which could be fixed with future patches or firmware updates), but when you boot up Uncharted and see it running so beautifully on a portable, it makes you tend to forget there are any downsides to the system at all.

Overall Score: 8/10

Pros: screen size, two analog sticks, graphically very impressive, great sound, lot of control options, multitasking, good d-pad

Cons: awful browser, poor camera quality, proprietary memory/cables, need to format system to switch PSN IDs",5.0,B005IMVP0O,Great portable system!,Video Games

"To many, Chrono Trigger is the best RPG ever made. I'd say it's as good as Final Fantasy 6 or 7, but not better. Although I rate it 5 stars, 4.5 stars is closer to it. It all has to do with the final ending boss--Lavos--and his three forms. In my opinion, Lavos is right up there with Kefka and Sephiroth, but Lavos isn't human, so that makes him the best non-human antagonist ever seen in a game. Lavos first appears as a porcupine-like creature. His eerie scream is as good as Kefka's laugh, too. After defeating the Lavos shell, you go inside and fight the machine part of Lavos. Looks okay, but not great. You beat that, then fight the last version of Lavos--the vegetable-looking version. He doesn't look evil, nor does he look good. So it's awful hard to hate him. The background effect is okay, but sorta annoying, and the music at that point is bland. But that's the only problem that I have with the game--the final ending boss. Everything preceding that is top-notch Squaresoft. The storyline is really great on this game. My favorite parts are: Chrono's Trial (as good as the opera scene in FF6), the Future (especially the bike race against that Prince-like guy), the Battle against Magus in his castle is especially awesome because the music fits in so PERFECTLY with the battle. The little movie scene showing Lavos falling to earth is also a joy to see. There are ten endings to this game and many sidequests.

"Innovation is not one of EA's strong suits, and Criterion has basically built the same game over and over.  Paradise, on the other hand, does things a little differently, incorporating a big, open world along the lines of a Grand Theft Auto.  While the sandbox elements are light, there are a ton of different races to participate in, and once the taste is acquired, it is a good one.

However, it won't do anything to convert those who don't care much for racing games--Mario Kart doesn't count!--, and it may alienate those expecting more of the same, which is what EA normally tends to deliver.

The on-line play is excellent, smooth, and well-integrated.",4.0,B000MUXLOK,EA takes a gamble for once.,Video Games

But they didn't take the time to improve this game.  I couldn't recommend this game to anyone who was a serious strategy gamer.
The model for these types of games have been established by the Total War series, like it or not.  All games of this type will be judge by that standard.  It's like they missed that event.

"When I saw this game at Bestbuy and Target, I was surprised because I haven't really heard of it. I bought it used last week from Amazon which was 1/3 of the original price and I'm glad to report that I just finished playing the game on PS3 10 minutes ago - this is probably one of the most underrated games of 2010. I like Mech games and this one really hits the spot, I could not put the controller down. The story is very engaging and decently conceived but this game is definitely not without flaws. I appreciate that the creators wanted to mix it up a little bit between Wanzer action and foot combat but the latter was pretty bad. I dread the time when I had to get out of my Wanzer and go on foot but it actually helped fill in the storyline. Sometimes during Wanzer action in the jungle, the leaves and trees get in the way of your view.
The good thing is that there were not a lot of foot missions. It is a fun game but you also have to think - the success of your mission lies behind how you customize your Wanzer and boy have I really spent a lot of time going back to the drawing board if a configuration does not work which is pretty good with all the statistics and numerical figures for a certain weapon/part etc. The boss battles were pretty challenging especially the one with Cornelius.

Overall I really like this game, I guess beauty lies on the eyes and taste of the beholder. If you are not a Mech fan then this game will just be so-so but hardcore Mech fans like me, it's a blast. Voice acting was decent as well, graphics were very good during Wanzer action but characters have facial wonkiness at times. The design of the Wanzers were also pretty well conceived.

In the end, I could not get enough - I wish there were more levels to play. Hope this review helps.",4.0,B002BXJ9VA,Pretty Good! I wish there were more levels to play.,Video Games

"Pros:

- Beautiful, detailed graphics (if your computer can handle it). You get to see the character age too, and the details of his scars.

- Lots of fun little side things to do. (Marry people and have sex, steal stuff, kill people secretly at night and then buy their homes  or buy their shops--allows you to own an entire town)

- Nice weapons and other random items to play with

- Combat is kinda fun too, especially if you add a lot of magic to your regular fighting too. Oh and, shooting for people's heads is fun too. (You can also kick the head afterwards.)

Cons:

- Short game. 20+ hours or so. BTW, after the credits, wait like 20min and you CAN get back to the game to finish off business.

- Pretty easy game. You can be invincible halfway through if you wanted to.

- The good versus bad thing... the ""bad"" side doesn't have a lot of advantages... except money, which can be easily obtained anyway in other ways if you try out things a bit.",4.0,B000A76ZNO,Fun but flawed game,Video Games

"I am a huge fan of Ezio and AC2 is one of my favorite games of all time. Needless to say I was extremely hyped for this game. It is definitely not as good as the previous two installments in the Ezio Trilogy (AC2, Brotherhood, and Revelations), but that still makes it an above average game. Constantinople (Istanbul) is the setting and I can't recall it being nearly as memorable as the other two. There are also some smaller locations. A certain extremely impressive locale that I won't mention in case it would spoil the game for those, but was probably the best of the series albeit a short part of the overall game. Going back to Altair was indeed refreshing as his story seemed to need much more explaining. Combat was indeed the best although I wasn't a fan of the new bomb crafting.

The game's biggest downfall is that it is short. To be honest, I was a little taken aback when the credits began to roll. Next, I won't delve too deep into the implemented tower defense initiative that was tacked on since that is universally regarded as a pitfall of the game. While the game did offer more detail into the paranormal nature of the series, I was still disappointed with the ""revelations"" as implied in the title. There wasn't too much revealed that was already known. I was let down by this. I was waiting for a huge twist and there was none. Anyone that has played one of Ubisoft's other franchises, Prince of Persia, will immediately see its influence on a certain side mission series in this game. I found it to be quite irritating to be honest. Lastly, Desmond's story continues to be boring and the implemented little game was pretty pointless.

Overall, it was fun and added some much needed detail to the story, but not worth the full price of $60.",4.0,B004YVOCV4,Feels more of an extension than its own title,Video Games

"I've used this gamepad for about a year now, and I don't recommend it. It gets 2 stars because yes, it does work, and yes, most games on PC recognize it as either a Playstation Controller, (for emulator programs, definitely a plus) or as an Xbox controller for near everything else. The wireless set-up is great, I loved not having any cords to mess with, and the battery life has been SUPERB. I have 40 plus games on Steam and about 10 on Origin, and as far as being recognized as a controller, it's never failed. So why wouldn't I recommend it?

The MASSIVE problem is with the trigger design, and analog sticks' button design. The trigger buttons need a ton of pressure to activate, and they don't feel truly analog. You'll spend the first few weeks just working to develop the finger strength to use them right, and another few weeks getting the sensitivity to know how hard to pull on them for it to count as halfway or all the way depressed. I have Watch_Dogs and Assassin's Creed: Black Flag for Steam, and my hand would literally cramp up from holding down the right trigger button while driving or free running in either game. I can't even imagine what would happen to Grand Theft Auto players. I'm a pretty strong guy, I workout 3 times a week with weights and I do martial arts, and for my hands to be cramping trying to keep that silly trigger down should tell you all you need to know.

 And what's worse is that in under a year of using it, the trigger buttons will start to goof up on you. How you ask? Well, they will activate when you're not pressing the button, or deactivate when you are. Since the trigger buttons are key for almost every shooter, stealth game, or driving game, this is a MAJOR problem. I can't even describe how annoying it is to be lining up a sniping shot in Metal Gear Solid: The Phantom Pain to all of the sudden zip out of the lens scope and see Snake start punching in air because the two trigger buttons won't work properly. In Dead Space 3, I'll have Issac trying to lower his gun with no luck, or he'll suddenly empty his clip into thin air meaning my likely quick death since I'm stuck with slow walking and turning and no ammo. The only solution has been to open up the battery casing, slide one of the batteries out of contact with the plate, put it back in and keep playing. Until it happens again and you have to repeat the process. I'd say in an hour's worth of playing I'll likely have to do this about every 5 minutes... if I'm being generous.

The two analog sticks work well, but now the R3 and L3 function, (when you push down on the analog stick to activate them as a button) are dying as well. The L3 button especially, (again, a button usually used to activate a sprint or vision function in shooters/stealth games) now takes several pushes before the function activates.

It's very frustrating. If not for those lousy trigger buttons and analog stick buttons, this thing is a great sell for a great price! There's other reviews out there that say the same thing about them, it's a common problem. Every other button on it works perfectly and feels really solid and responsive. It's almost a Greek tragedy that so much of this thing is so good, only to be ruined by what is so bad! I have old Playstation, Playstation 2, Xbox, Xbox 360, and PS3 controllers that even after years of using them work phenomenally. For this to be breaking down in under a year shows really shoddy design.

I love gaming on my PC, and this controller, (during the first 6 months) was a blast even with hand cramps because I could kick back across the room wirelessly. Now it's such a headache that I nearly want to throw it across the room every game I play. I just ordered an Xbox controller with a PC cable because I couldn't take it anymore.

If, (and this is a key *if*), you don't put much wear and tear on it, it might be worth it for the price and may last longer. However, if you don't use an Xbox or Playstation console and instead do all your gaming on PC, (like I do), then you're better off shelling out the extra bucks on a better controller.",2.0,B0041RR0TW,Buyer Beware!

"Risk 2 is definitely worth the bargain price.  The many different gameplay options allow for different challenges for one or more players.

This game allows for intense gameplay while quality time with family or friends.  The tournament is extremely challenging because it forces you to play the game in the different modes which does not allow you to develop a consistent strategy.  This is a plus because games that allow you to form and follow a set strategy get boring and monotanous after a short time.  The ""Same Time"" strategy takes a little while to get used to, but definitely is an addition that benefits the game.

If you and a fellow player attack the computer at the same location, for instance, once the computer has been defeated, you and your buddy ""go at it"".  You also have to watch out for ""surge attacks"" where an opponent can attack you one place and then immediately go into the next country while you're not even aware of it.

"When I picked up this EP I will admit I was becoming a little bored with the base game.  After logging more hours than I would care to count playing the game it was starting to feel a little monotonous and like there wasn't as much to explore.  I'm glad I bought this EP because it added richness to the game.  Installing it, each life stage feels even more distinctive and involved.  There are new create a sim features, new traits, new lifetime rewards, new party types, fieldtrips, a new daycare profession, new places to woohoo, new creatures, new rabbit holes, afterschool activities, and more.  It's quite the long list and it does feel like that when you play the game.  I really enjoyed new features that hadn't been there before, especially sending my teen sim to prom, having a bachelorette party before a wedding, and the new objects like working strollers, treehouses and more.

Another included feature in the game is the ability to send child & teen sims away to boarding school.  While they are gone you effectively can't play them, but they can still call home and you can call them.  They also learn new skills while they are gone and get traits, though they didn't learn nearly as many skills as the teen I kept at home and played normally.  It does cost money to send the to one of the boarding skills, but it is nice if you want to have a robust family tree because taking care of all those children in addition to daily responsibilities for your adult sims can be tough.  The only disappointment is that while they are away you can't keep track of where they are in their age progression or what traits they might be gaining in real time.

While I do love this game overall, I do have some slight nits.  I wish they had an option to have an ongoing nanny vs. constantly calling for a babysitter.  I also think, as I've felt with other EP's, they don't provide nearly enough objects/items.  Sims 3 has been pretty stingy with them across the board, probably in an effort to get people to buy things in the online store.  I especially wish they had offered a range of wedding dresses.  Considering how much of it is about the dress, that seemed like a miss, though I do feel like the fashions have been lacking overall in the whole Sims 3 franchise.

"Honestly, I wasn't expecting much from Infamous Second Son because I just couldn't get excited about it. Sure, it looked great (from a graphics perspective) but I thought the gameplay reminded me of Prototype, which isn't a good thing. Well, I'm glad I didn't rely on the walkthrough footage from YouTube, because I would have missed out on a fantastic game!

Combat - Second Son hangs it's hat on being a third person shooter, and does a very good job in that department. There's no auto-aim, so you'll have to be pretty precise in order to hit your targets. I don't want to leave out melee attacks because you'll sometimes be forced to use them when an enemy chooses to get a little 'up close and personal'. Stealth combat is a welcomed addition because you'll sometimes find it a little easier to sneak up behind an enemy and kill him without causing a commotion. The only aspect of combat that I didn't like was the inability to switch hands whiles shooting. For example, if you're using a pillar as cover, it would be ideal to be able to switch shooting hands and have a cleaner shot at the bad guys. We had this functionally in the first two Infamous games.

Weaponry - Initially, you'll only have a chain as your main weapon (melee attack). But as you progress through the game, you'll acquire four more powers (smoke, neon, video, and concrete). I won't go into too much detail because they're all pretty much 'point and shoot' types of powers. My favorite of the lot was probably smoke because it was the most accessible. You'll be able to drain smoke from any car, as well as several other smoke sources around town. My least favorite was the neon power because I found it to be the least effective out of the four. Video power was the hardest to come by. Some districts had a few video sources here and there, while other districts didn't have any at all. The concrete power was probably the most enjoyable one to use, but be aware that you will not gain it until very late in the campaign.

Enemies - This is probably the weakest area of the game (although not a big deal). The enemy variety is pretty low, but it doesn't matter because the battles are so much fun! The enemies are members of the 'D.U.P.' military group, and they all look very similar. Think of it this way: The enemies in the Batman games look pretty similar but that didn't detract from the game, did it? Same can be said for Second Son. The street battles are so epic in scale that you won't give a damn about who looks like what (nor will you have time to). There aren't very many boss battles, but I thoroughly enjoyed the few that were included in the game. I won't give too much away, but there's a fight with a winged fellow that's simply LEGENDARY, and I'll leave it at that.

Miscellaneous - Don't be mislead by the reviewers who are crying about how short the game is. If you play the game how it was meant to be played; meaning partaking in ALL of the sidemissions, you'll be rewarded with a very fulfilling gaming experience. Outside of blast shards (used to level up powers) there isn't much to collect. This is a sandbox type of game, so exploration is limited to the several districts that make up the city of Seattle. Second Son is not without it's flaws. I assumed I would be able to possess all four powers at once, but that's not the case. In other words, you can't have more than one power at the same time, and I think that sucks. However, I still love Second Son and it's my favorite of the series because it wasn't afraid to step outside the box and use a different approach to how powers were used and acquired. With that being said, it still managed to feel like an Infamous game, which is tricky to pull off. Plants vs Zombies: Garden Warfare, you're up next!",5.0,B00BGAA0SU,Best of the Franchise,Video Games
"I first bought this without looking at the reveiws at amazon, but i found i thoroughly enjoyed it.  It was the first tycoon game that was in 3d which was why i bought it.  I really like tycoon games.  This one was great!  The missions are clearly possible, the graphics are great, the gameplay is great and the structures look really cool.  Even the inflatable houses look neat.  There are some cons though.  Such as:  The screen movement is choppy and it's VERY hard to keep your budget in tact.  In the reagular version you start out with 50000 dollars to build your entire colony.  When you finally finish you can look back at your work and enjoy it because the layout they made is beautiful, a real eye opener.  I too wished when i was playing this game that i could just settle in one of my colonys.  It is clear how any sim would want to settle in on someone's colony.
Recommendations: I would recommend this to anyone who is good at keeping good budget at these games.

"<-- Graphics -->
The visuals in the game are simply stunning. I've never seen more realistic waterfalls or lightning effects than in this game. Standing on the shore, waves will roll in and darken the sand, which then lightens again once the water recedes. Caves seem infinitely dark until you step inside and your eyes adjust, and likewise, the view outside is overexposed and blinding until you do the same. Square's visual staff produces some simply amazing stuff, and the attention to even the smallest of details adds to the realism of the world. Granted, some might consider the hardware requirements a bit steep to elicit all of this wonderful imagery, but you can't deny, it's a damn pretty game.

<-- Environment -->
While the cities are fine, the outside environment leaves much to be desired. The game right now consists, literally, of three zones, each reminiscent of a primary zone in FFXI, and generally with some elements of other zones thrown in. Unfortunately, while very realistic and well done, the landscapes are devoid of anything... interesting. Very realistic, and very generic, landscapes are what await you.

<-- Sound -->
The sound, both music and effects, are what you'd expect from Square-Enix. Very well done.

<-- Combat -->
Combat classes in this game are defined by the weapon you equip, which sounds very strange at first, but makes more sense once you discover that ""classes"" are arbitrary, and only serve to indicate your level of mastery at whatever skill your main hand item uses. Combat is basically the same as it was in FFXI, with some minor adjustments. Your auto-attacks now aren't, and all of your skills use stamina, which builds up automatically during combat. TP generation (by basic attacks) is much faster, and weapon skills are a much more common element of battle. The game also has a system similar to skillchains, which might see more use if party play was necessary or even encouraged.

<-- Gathering -->
There are three gathering classes, Fisherman, Botanist, and Miner. All three employ the same mini-game (with some minor differences, mostly in terminology) which decides whether or not you've gathered successfully. Once you figure the mechanics out, it's fairly easy to keep yourself from failing repeatedly, and the learning curve is short. However, it doesn't do anything to relieve the tedium of gathering. You may welcome the gathering mini-game as a device to help you stay awake while doing it, or you may view it as just one more unnecessary task to perform in the process.

<-- Crafting -->
Crafting is necessary in this game, for equipment, and for repairs. The system itself is an irritating time sink. While there are different crafting ""methods"" that you can use during the process, it seems to have little to no effect on the outcome of the craft, except where it relates to the assessment of your guildleve work. Most of the time, unless you're well above your craft (by ten or more levels, at least) you will be using the standard method, which will involve sitting there and pressing the ""enter"" key eight or ten times while you wait for the game to decide whether you won the dice roll or not.

There are many crafting ""skills"" which, while not required by a particular craft, may be ""recommended"" for it. You can only acquire these skills through the trading of guild points, and you will suffer a rather severe penalty to the craft without them.

Repairs are one particular element of the game that I found irritating in the extreme. Even though I have friends who play who could effect repairs for me on items they made (and likewise for myself, on items made for them) we found several instances of items crafted that could not be repaired by the crafter, due to a lack of skill. Add to that the fact that we tend to be in numerous different areas, and it makes the whole thing rather inconvenient.

It wouldn't be so inconvenient if performing any sort of activity didn't reduce the durability of your items so quickly, but the biggest culprit here is your underwear, and an hour of intense play will require you to stop, swap it out for a second set that you keep on hand for this purpose only (you can't simply unequip your drawers, no going commando here) to repair. There are repair NPCs that can repair you enough to keep you going (to 75%, you suffer reduced effect at 50%) but on higher-level crafted items, the price is amazingly high for this service. When gathering, be advised to unequip anything that's expensive or not easily repaired.

<-- Economy -->
The economy directly pulls the bazaar system from FFXI. Additionally, in lieu of a mog house or bank system, you're provided with a retainer that can hold as many items as you can, and you're permitted to set this retainer up in a city's market ward, where you can basically bazaar from the NPC. There is no auction house in the game. While I can understand the reasoning behind the lack of it (camping and price-gouging issues), those reasons simply aren't good enough. Nobody wants to spend, quite literally, hours hunting through hundreds of bazaars hoping to ~maybe~ find the item they're looking for (and personally, I adamantly refuse). The abundance of bazaars makes loading agonizingly slow in both areas of town where they're prevalent, and in the market wards.

Bazaars are great for making casual sales. In FFXI, I would check people in the field or at random in towns to see if they had anything I could use, but when looking for something specific that you need, an easily searchable system, like an auction house, is quite simply required. The game's economy is utterly broken, and will remain broken, until this feature is added.

Also, there is no system in place for mail, at all. This feature's exclusion is a huge failure.

<-- Storyline and Questing -->
The storyline, what little exists of it, seems completely disconnected from the rest of the game, and as of yet, the primary storyline is the only quest line that exists in the game. Repeatable guildleves aren't quests so much as a means by which to obtain guild points, and are reset every thirty-six hours on the server's schedule.

Ultimately, this leads to a sense of pointlessness. Without any kind of purpose, you roam the landscape, killing birds, rats, and various other forms of wildlife, improving your combat skills for no particular reason other than raising a number.

<-- Other Thoughts -->
In addition to the oddity of not being able to repair an item that you can craft, there are an unusual number of low-level crafts that require high-level items. So far, ~none~ of the foods I've eaten seem to have any noticeable effect, leading me to wonder if they even HAVE effects yet, or if the developers decided to save that for later. Additionally, there are areas in the game where there are obviously supposed to be guild shops (with guild signs outside of buildings), but no shop exists to enter.

Those along with numerous other factors, leave me with the final impression that the game is simply incomplete, like they needed another month or six to flesh it out before release. I honestly feel like I'm paying to beta test. While it has a lot of nice features, and a lot of potential, and I really, really, really want to like it, I just can't recommend this game to anyone at this point.",2.0,B006IUVDOS,"Incomplete, a mess, and a chore.",Video Games

"Well I think by this time everyone including non-gamers have heard about World of warcraft. Its in the news, its on tv, its talked about at work, school, college etc. Families play the game together and the game has even contributed towards breaking of relationsips, falling of grades, people losing jobs etc but inspite of all these facts World of warcraft is still the best MMO out there. Lots of MMO's have come and gone trying to compete or take over the throne from this game but none have suceeded thus far. I have personally over the years have switched back and forth between wow and others mmo's to only come back to wow. This game has some strange and almost majical allure to it.

This all being said I throughly enjoy the game. It's very solo friendly. Has top-notch graphics and the biggest aspect is the huge world which truly does justice to the words 'epic' and 'massive' when its comes to mmo's. The game has both a good and a darker faction to play. The classes are numerous and well thought off too. You have everything from pure specialized classes to hybrids. Choose your faction, pick a class and off you go. The game caters to different playstyle too...for pve oriented people you have pve servers and for hardcore pvp oriented people you have pvp servers(full of gankage and griefing if thats what you like). However, the great thing about the game is that even being on pve servers you have various option to pvp and test your mettle against real players. A person can flag themselves for world pvp or participate in instanced battlegrounds(my favourite)to pvp at your time and choosing. The game also has the feel that there is a constant war going on among an epic struggle between different factions for resources and philosphies. Cities gets attacked, players gets attacked and there are constant raging battles going in battlgrounds.

But aside from all this the game offers some of the most fun questing that i have ever come across in mmo's. If you want to just quest and better your character via leveling it up than the game will grip you too and no wonder people are known to loose a part of their life to this game. But my advice....'Moderation' and you will be all happy both in real and your virtual life.

In conclusion....I will advice this game to anyone who is intrested in playing a great mmo that is not a bore also. A testament to this is my 2 years with this game among all the other posters who gave this game high marks too. Check it out yourself but 'BEWARE'..they are lots of 'clones' out there but none have even half the majic or charm or fun which is the hallmark of a game called World of Warcraft.",5.0,B000067FDW,Been playing the game since its release almost 2 years ago........,Video Games

"Secret of Mana is one of my favorite SNES games. I enjoyed Seiken Densetsu 2 and Sword of Mana as well, but somehow I missed out on this game during its original run. Lured by the stylistic graphics and great soundtrack, I picked this up on PSN. Even at only $5.99 for play on your PSP and/or PS3, I could only recommend this for diehard Mana series fans.

The game's biggest strengths are its graphics and music. Pretty much everything else disappoints to varying degrees.

With its silent protagonist and NPCs that run off when it suits them, there really is no overarching storyline, just a series of quests. Because the steps in those quests can be so vague, long periods of time may lapse between story beats, meaning that you never quite know or care what's going on and you never get vested in any of the characters. At one point, I realized I was deliberately aiding the enemy by killing important good guys and wondered why. The only explanation is that you have to in order to finish that quest. The elemental spirits have zero role in the plot and only exist to give you coins for crafting. Wasted opportunity.

This game is extremely tedious, and the paper thin plot stringing it together makes it even more so. The backgrounds are nice to look at, but you will come across many a door that can't be opened, and what appear to be obvious paths are often inexplicably not. Final Fantasy VII had a feature that would highlight the exit paths with a triangle, but not here. I played this game downloaded to my PSP and I can't imagine how much more frustrating the numerous loading screens would be to someone playing the actual disc version of this game. This is particularly bad in towns where you may actually spent more time watching the bouncing Rabbite on the loading screen than actually traversing the screen. Quests are often extremely vague, and the in-game diary is worthless as an aid. Despite having a companion (frequently), there's no way to get any advice from them the way you could in, say, Dragon Quest VII. Finally, on this subject of tedium, there are the dungeons, which are simply a chore. Enemies respawn whenever you revisit a screen and you MUST defeat them in order to proceed. Since you will do a lot of wandering around, revisiting every locale on the map to try and figure out how to trigger then next stage of a quest, this gets irritating very quickly, for a very important reason...

COMBAT IS SO BORING! It feels more like a side-scrolling brawler than an RPG, because your character only really attacks left and right and everything boils down to strong and weak attack. Magic is underpowered and irrelevant and there's no concept of items. You literally just hit the attack button until your enemies are dead...which won't be long, because this is one of the easiest games I've played. Literally nothing poses a challenge and every boss, including the final one, can be defeated in about a minute just by spamming the attack button. You can make the enemies harder in New Game+, but by that point you'll probably have had enough of this game.

Overall, this game is worth the price of admission ($6 on PSN, not the ridiculous prices listed here) if you are a fan of the series. It is not a terrible game, but it pales in comparison to its predecessors. If you want to simply experience this entry in the series, I would recommend using a walkthrough just to preserve your sanity.",3.0,B00004SWM0,For Dedicated Fans Only,Video Games

"How to start off for this review, well as someone who really enjoys platformers there haven't been a lot (even when the game came out) that felt really good. This game not only feels great gameplay wise but even adds to it with over the top guns, funny dialogue, fun and charming characters as well as a wonderful art style.

The game does a lot with the PS2 and has a lot of gameplay to offer, even when I got this at full price I still say it's worth it.

A lot of people seem to compare this game to Jak & Daxster like they're competing titles or that R&C are ripping off J&D, I think what many don't know is the devs know eachother and the guys from J&D GAVE THEM THE ENGINE that powers these games and even feature Jack & Daxter in some way in shape and form in the Ratchet & Clank games, even as a playable character.

"Typically, I'm more of a first-person-shooter kind of game.  I don't like games where I have to do a lot of button mashing in combat.  Which is to say in a game like Fable, I was casting spells and shooting my guns, and in oblivion I never used the swords but relied on magic.

And my favorite games are games like Mass Effect, Fallout 3, Gears, Left 4 Dead, and Call of Duty.

Which is probably why I disliked the original Assassin's Creed so much.  It felt overwhelming.  I couldn't ""get"" the combat.  I didn't enjoy it at all.  I felt like it threw you in to the deep end right from the beginning.  I played it a few hours, got probably less than 100 gamer score out of it, and put it down forever.

I found this for 39 bucks and picked it up against my better instincts.  And you know what?  I'm really starting to like it.  This game does a much better job of immersing you in the story and the controls.  It all feels more structured--though technically open world--and it is more of a guided experience.  At least the main story line is.  There's not a lot of time spent traveling, and I like that.  And as much as I hate button-mashing combat, that part of the game is actually pretty simple (no stupid combos--just fluid like on Arkham Asylum).

Sprinkle in the exploration, multiple ways to attack a plot point, and the RPG elements, and you have a very impressive game.

"I have been unable to download the game since before it launched (pre-load). 5 times I've tried downloading this game. Windows 10 store downloads are, for some reason, slower than my maximum download speed. Not fun with a 60GB download. In addition to this, my download has made progress up to 50% and then resets randomly back to 0%. When I get a good download speed going but need my internet connection to do other things, I pause the download. Upon resuming the download, it resets back to 0%. Sometimes it will say X/50GB or X/39GB or, as of tonight, X/79GB.

My conclusion is that this is an issue with Microsoft and their ""store"". Even worse, I can't even find any trace of the actual download in Win10 so I cannot personally verify how much is or isn't on my hard drive.

"Definitely the best Spider-Man game since Spider-Man 2 for the last-gen systems, Spider-Man: Web of Shadows takes the wall-crawler and his open world New York City to a whole new level.  Playing as Spidey and being able to alternate between the classic and black costumes, you swing around New York City cracking heads and saving citizens, which is pretty much what we've been doing since Spider-Man 2.  However, what's different with Web of Shadows is that the game rarely becomes boring and the missions rarely become tedious to boot.  Also, the game's story is a surprising blast to play through.  The longer you play Web of Shadows, the more you'll get enthralled, particularly in its final acts where the symbiotes begin to wreak havoc.  The ability to (somewhat) choose your own path depending on your actions is a plus, and there's plenty of appearances from familiar faces on the sides of heroes and villains as well.  The only real flaws of Web of Shadows are technical ones.  There are some noticeable graphical glitches and sound hiccups, plus a few issues with the in-game camera.  Still, swinging around New York City has never been more fun or easy to do, and the game manages to stay entertaining from start to finish.

"As you probably read before, this is not a traditional Metroid, but it is still a very good game and one of the best games on Wii.

The game starts a bit slow, with too many cutscenes and not challenging. Worse is that the story at the beginning sucks, I thought all of Samus past and the ""thumbs down"" thing was ridiculous and I was very disappointed with the game in the first 2 hours.

Fortunately after that the game got better, more challenging and the story got interesting.

This Metroid is more action oriented and I liked that, however is also very linear, and if you don't like to search for items you can finish it in less than 8 hrs. It took me 14 hrs to finish the game but I liked to search a lot, and 20 hrs to get the 100%. The bad thing about exploration in this game is that you can only get missiles, energy and accel parts. All your weapons are already in your possession but can't use them until you're authorized (lame).

I liked the gameplay controls, had absolute no problem playing with the D-Pad, and I like pointing to shoot missiles. I bought the Wii for this kind of ideas and I want to see more of them implemented in the future.

The biggest disappointment for me was the music, or the lack of. Seriously sometimes the game got very boring because of this, and I missed the classic Metroid melodies.

+ Great graphics

- The first 2 hours are a bit boring

"I'll write this review as if I'm reviewing two items. First the Ear Force DSS breakout box, and then the PX21 headset that it comes packaged with. Keep in mind, my experience here is with Win8.1 PC setup only.

The Ear Force DSS is actually a pretty solid piece of equipment. It is NOT a USB sound card. If you connect this to your PC it will never recognize it as a USB device at all. The DSS simply gets it's power through USB and also offers an additional USB pass-through port on it so you can connect other devices as if it's just a USB extension cord. The DSS takes audio input from your PC's surround sound optical output and translates that into virtual stereo surround sound, and the effect is pretty convincing. It gives your audio that 5.1 big home theater sound with realistic room reverb making it seem like there's a wide space between you and the surrounding speakers. The DSS surround sound works with ANY headphones, no need to use the headset provided. The DSS will allow you to play audio out from it's headphone jack as well as your speaker system simultaneously meaning you can quickly switch between headphones and speaker listening without unplugging anything or changing any settings. The DSS seems to add a heavy layer of bass to your audio, and without tweaking a few soundcard settings the DSS will overdrive/distort/clip any audio you play through it. Once you solve this by greatly lowering optical output levels it works great though.

The DSS is great, however, the PX21 headset that's provided is not my first choice to use along side it. The PX21 does NOT work at all without USB power provided to it, so you can't use it on an MP3 player or other audio source that doesn't have a powered USB port. The PX21 has a persistent hissing white noise that doesn't go away no matter what volume you use or what audio/usb ports you use, it's always interlaced into whatever you're listening to. If you can tolerate the white noise the audio quality is actually pretty decent, no real complaints there. Comfort wise, the ear cups are soft and breathable, but they have a kind of burlap mesh cloth on their surface that can feel a bit rough on my sensitive ears. The ear cups do not go over my ears, they rest ontop of them all around causing pressure and discomfort after 30 minutes of use. The cord is ridiculously long and heavy. if you don't clip the inline controller to your shirt you'll feel that heavy cord tugging on your left ear. I haven't tested the mic, but I assume it's fairly basic and average in performance.

Overall, DSS is a nice piece of equipment for a good virtual surround sound experience that is pretty versatile in how many ways you can use it. The PX21 headset is the weakest part of this package.",2.0,B0042Y2F76,"DSS breakout box is great, PX21 headset provided is not.",Video Games
"I got this game almost a year ago. I've played the game a lot, unlocked all the characters and have played about 100 matches online. I've been a fan of Soul Calibur since Soul Calibur 2, which I purchased on my Gamecube. Soul Calibur 4 is the updated version of the series on the Xbox 360 and the Playstation 3. The roster includes about 30 fighters, a dozen stages and a character creator mode.

In the singleplayer department, you get 3 modes. The first mode is Story Mode. What happens here is that you are shown a written history of the character before you even play. Then you are shown a screen with some odd collections of words such as ""A Dark Warrior"" and proceed to fight a match. New to the series, is the addition of tag teaming. With a press of a button, you can switch your characters in a match. After you beat the normal enemies you face the boss and are treated to a short cutscene.

Then there is arcade mode. In this mode, you fight enemy after enemy until you get to the end with the same boss. One thing that I think improves on SC2 is that the boss does not always predict your moves and counter it so effectively. Nor does he have some move that takes out half of you life. He's simply a normal fighter, except with twice the amount of health.

Finally, you have a Tower of Souls mode. This mode has two variations. You either ""ascend"" and fight tough enemies or you can ""descend"" and fighter hordes of weaker enemies, sort of like survival mode in the old games.

That's about it for the singleplayer modes, other than practice and character creation. Now for character creation, you can change things such as the sex, the weapon, clothes, hair/eye/skin color, name and a few other things. The clothes and items that you use also affect the attributes of your character. You can also take a custom character online.

As for multiplayer mode, you are given two options, normal and special versus. Normal is simply a normal mode, where status effects are not played. So items don't mean anything. Special versus is where the clothes you have chosen have status effects that work. Interestingly, there is no tag-team mode. You can also play online, either casual or ranked. Latency will affect gameplay, making moves much more difficult to time.

So what is my opinion on the game? As the title implies, I'm not completely satisfied. Yes, the graphics are great, the gameplay is still there and you do get more characters, but I think a lot of additions are unnecessary.

The critical finishes that they've worked in the game rarely happen and contribute nothing to the gameplay. It's just extra fluff. The character creation mode is confusing because it's not clearly explained. Choosing gear will take certain slots which is shared with abilities. Also, the equipment looks goofy and silly most of the time. Most players simply make revealing female fighters online.

Speaking of which, the female characters in the game do not need to have implants and revealing outfits. The singleplayer modes don't add new modes such as the conquest mode of SC3. They added tag-teaming in singleplayer, yet fail to include it for multiplayer, which is yet another question. Yoda just doesn't fit in the game. Having a character that can not be grabbed or horizontally attacked is cumbersome.

Online play is painful, especially if you have a slow character. Fast characters can spam their moves and interrupt fighters that operate slowly. Now you are supposed to counter these pokes with guard impacts, but that technique requires timing, which the online latency makes impossible.

The best way to play this game, as with all fighting games is with a competent buddy in your living room. The core game itself is very strategic, where pattern recognition and applying counters is a key part. Soul Calibur sets itself apart form other fighters because it's not execution that wins the game, but strategic decisions that determine the outcome.

Overall, it doesn't reinvent the series and if you have older games, the game only feels like a patch. The online mode is the only significant addition that sets SC4 apart from the older titles. If you can bear some issues with online play, then it's worth a purchase. Otherwise, I would purchase an older copy, save myself $50 or so and still experience 90% of what Soul Calibur 4 is.",3.0,B000ZKDOVW,Lost its Soul,Video Games

"Fable II is beautiful, charming, and funny.  It's everything you could possibly ask for in a spouse, -er I mean video game.  The humor can be somewhat childish (farting in public) but can also be laugh out loud hilarious!

What motivates you?  Is it love?  Is it revenge?  Is it a desire to protect all that you hold dear?  Is it the desire to acquire more things, money, and respect from others?  All of those can be very powerful motivators, and you can find all of them in Fable II.

Fable II is everything you loved about Fable I only more of it.  (If it ain't broke don't fix it, right?)  You can still buy shops and houses, only now you can set the price of rent and goods.  (and get good or evil points in the process)  You can also buy and upgrade each individual piece of furniture for your houses.  You can still get married, but now you can turn any house into a marriage house.  The towns look familiar, but are much bigger.  You could spend a lifetime just doing all of the side missions.  The choices are endless.

You get out of it what you put into it.  If you really work to keep your wife happy, she will keep you VERY happy. ;)  (and give you children if you so choose)

Not only can you buy every piece of property in the game, but you can also rename every townsperson who isn't a main character.  Your creativity can run rampant here.  I already have a well endowed, cleavage showing woman named [...] McGee and a bisexual cultivator of crops called [...] the Farmer.

Online and offline co-op is a nice addition from the last iteration as well.  You can drop in and drop out almost as seamlessly as in the Lego games.  Like the Lego games you share the same screen (offline, haven't played online yet).  One of the biggest frustrations with sharing the same screen is when the 2 players go 2 different directions.  This can be easily remedied by player 2 pressing the back button to warp up next to player 1.

Graphics: 9.5  Artwork in motion, characters are a little cartoon-ish though
Gameplay: 12!  You could spend hours acquiring land, spouses, and children, hunting treasure and playing with your dog!
Story: 9  Clichd yet intriguing
Music: 10  The background orchestra music fits perfectly with the setting
Voice Acting:  9.5  Very well done, yet most voices are the same as the last Fable, who knows maybe you sound exactly like your ancestors from 500 yrs ago

The bottom line: if you're willing to invest the time and effort into Fable II, it is VERY rewarding.",5.0,B0014ET6EM,Fable II is the reason you play video games,Video Games

"Ok...first i would like to thank all those that gave this game a 3 star or under....your are not that smart....first off....the controller is quite easy to get used to...just play the first level..its a training level.
20 levels...only 5 of those are hard...about 10 are easy if u know wat to do and the other 5 are normal.
The freedom is huge. You get to do things you won't be able to do in other games... kill the mailman,take is clothes and flowers..go into da house, hide in da corner..wait wait NOW,KILL THE BODY GUARD..take his clothes and the golf club and kill the don..thats only half of level 2. The best thing is there are all sorts of ways to beat the levels. some levels also continue from others...makes you wanna be a hitman.
The graphics as well are very well indeed. so the music...there are ALOT of weapons..from fiber wire to dual SD ballers...from golf clubs to custom rifles. from anestetics to sawed off shotguns...from katanas to AK-47. PLUS u can replay a lvl over and over and get ranks based by aggresion and stealth.

"I'm assuming this is the game I played, even though my copy says The Adventure Company on it. That said, any game I've played with The Adventure Company's brand has been... lacking. I feel like their M.O. is to purchase rights to mediocre games and resell them cheaply, so I really shouldn't be surprised by the quality I get from them after this.

As for the game itself, (Murder in) The Abbey is deceptive.  The box art is comically inaccurate to the game style, which is cell-shaded 3D characters with cartoonish proportions overlaying a mix of static 3D and hand-painted backgrounds (or hand-painting over 3D?). I can only guess that the hooded character on the cover is supposed to be the protagonist, despite looking like a villain, because he's the only one that even somewhat resembles the hooded character.  To be fair, it's good that they added ""Murder in"" to the title to give a better idea of what the game's about, because ""The Abbey"" alone says nothing at all about what's going on other than it takes place in a religious setting.

I have mixed feelings about the portrayal of these holy men, however--yes, having ""character flaws"" is human and more interesting to a narrative than making each one a stereotypical monk, besides providing red herrings as to the identity of the killer. However, I didn't end up liking any of them, except perhaps the cook Martin for throwing a lampshade on the fact that he knows he's being distracted. It just felt a bit forced having THAT many of the characters being revealed as so unlikable in-universe, that maybe we weren't supposed to feel so bad when bad things happened to them? How did they not all kill each other BEFORE this?

Furthermore, I got to rather dislike the protagonist, Leonardo de Toledo, after he started calling his slaveI MEAN HIS APPRENTICE Bruno stupid for not being able to grasp the Sherlock-esque leaps of logic he uses, and HATED him after he straight-up smacks him around. True, at age fourteen even in THIS day and age, Bruno should be smarter than that (unless he legitimately has learning disabilities, which makes it even worse that Leonardo beats him like a dog). Eleven or twelve I could've believed, but fourteen AND he's still that short?? Even allowing for the cartoony style, I felt like it broke my suspension of disbelief a little too much for comfort, as though we're SUPPOSED to think Bruno deserves a beating. I was tempted to let Leonardo die, but sadly the game doesn't allow it... props at least that there's no way to get ""stuck"" to where you can't progress due to having not picked up a vital item that's no longer available.

Most of my other complaints are nitpicky: Some of the puzzles, such as the one the rolling pin's used for, don't make sense, and I had to consult a walkthrough to solve those plus the ones I knew how to solve except I missed a step about talking to a different person first before the game would let me solve that puzzle. There are a LOT of quality-control issues in the spoken dialogue not matching the captions (which are too close to the edge of the screen), and in several scenes the Abbot stands backwards, looking away from the action. Also, the inventory is WAY too cluttered and arranged arbitrarily--I couldn't solve a puzzle because I didn't notice the item I was supposed to use was in a completely different location from the similar item I was trying to use. There's really no reason to have THAT many inventory slots, or to not be able to arrange the items better.

I do admit the game was slightly better than I expected, which is why it's not one star, but it still wasn't really worth my investment of time trying to get it to install when autoplay wouldn't run. Overall I guess it's okay for an afternoon-ish of ABSOLUTELY NOTHING better to do, but I wouldn't recommend buying it, not even to try to fulfill your Free Shipping quota for Amazon.",2.0,B001BFRPVK,Deceiving on many levels,Video Games

"Here's my take on Guitar Hero: it's a great game.  The song choice is varied enough to appeal to almost anyone.  In fact, I would say, in terms of song selection, this game's better than the sequel.  A word on that: the songs are covered, not the original performers.  The learning curve is relatively gradual, although there's a substantial increase in difficulty between medium and hard mode.  But within each level of difficulty, the game does a good job of slowly increasing the complexity of how you're moving your fingers across the fretboard.  The game also appeals to a wide variety of ability levels.  Easy and medium modes are great for the casual player.  Hard and extreme provide the expected levels of difficulty to players who want more out of the game.  The unlockable extras (unlocked with in-game cash) were well done, as none of them affect gameplay itself, but rather provide additional content to players who ""put in the time.""  This way, the game isn't turning away the less-addicted just because they didn't feel like getting carpal tunnel just to make a little extra game cash.

There are two factors that detract from the gaming experience: hammer-ons/pull-offs and the brevity of the game.  Hammer-ons/pull-offs were greatly improved in the sequel, but they weren't quite as polished as they could have been for this entry.  As a result, they can be tricky to do properly, and it doesn't feel like it would on a real guitar.  And the game's not necessarily short, there are just less songs in a career than the sequel.  One other point worth mentioning: the absence of a practice mode is also a drawback.

This is a great title for anyone who ever wanted to play guitar with a rockin' band, but hasn't yet devoted the time to learning how to play.  If you've ever turned your stereo up and rocked out, this game's for you.  If you've had a rough week and you just need to dance it out... go buy Dance Dance Revolution.

In short, it's a great game.  It's a wonder no one thought of this sooner.  It would have earned 5 stars if I had reviewed it BEFORE playing the sequel.",4.0,B000GDPHAE,"Better songs, a shorter experience",Video Games

"When Square-Enix puts out a numbered Final Fantasy title, it never disappoints.  But it's been painfully clear that any Final Fantasy spin-offs based on those games will miss the mark.  Such is the case with Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII.  If you're expecting the same engrossing gameplay and engagement you had playing the original Final Fantasy VII, you'll be sorely disappointed.

The bad:
-Horrible, and I do mean HORRIBLE play control.  You can seriously play through the battles blindfolded.  All you do is simply hit the X button.  The character moves on his own.  Square-Enix should've either given us traditional turn-based battles or fully controllable God of War-style battles, not this weak combination of both.

-The actual game is very short, with only 10 chapters.  After two hours of play, I was already in chapter 4, and that's after taking a good chunk of time doing side-missions as well.

-Side missions extend the game slightly, but they're also very short and not very engaging.

-DMW, which is a slot-machine-type meter that spins throughout the battle.  The player has no control over it, and this is what determines if you or your attributes level up, or if you perform a limit break or use a summon.  Basically, your progress and level is determined entirely at random (A level up happens when the first and last symbol match AND this corresponds to a 777).  No skill is required.

So why, you ask, did I give this game 4 stars?

The good:
Story - Plain and simple, the story is absolutely incredible.  The cutscenes are stunning, especially for the PSP.  The voice acting is the best I've ever heard...period.  The characters are convincing and engrossing.  The atmosphere throughout the game is classic FFVII, and this alone is why you won't be able to put the game down.

A review from GameInformer said that it's well worth trudging through some of the worst gameplay ever just to see this story to the end, and I whole-heartedly agree.  I'm hooked on it, and I'll gladly waste hours on side missions in the hope that I'll randomly level up, just so I can be strong enough to beat the final boss and bridge this story with Final Fantasy VII.",4.0,B0010YOQIW,"Cinematic and beautiful, but...",Video Games

The story has the awesomely bad quality of syfy movies, but the gameplay is where this game shines. The missions are cookie cutter but the story still manages to be fun as hell with the very unique gameplay mechanics with rico, his magic parachute and his grapple. You can grapple onto anything and launch yourslef into the air with your parachute , and keep grappling things while parachuting to speed around, you can parachute straight out of cars, you can jump ontop of cars, planes, hang off choppers. Its just epic and fun. YOu can hijack planes and choppers in mid air.

And with the use of mods like bolopatch you can make your grapple never break and get the ability to have multiple grapples at once, giving the game a new life. its just so fun to mess around in the massive gameworld trying to do the most ridiculous and daring stunts.

The game engine is DAMN impressive too. The draw distance and detail of the gameworld at a distance is the best I have ever seen. its vibrant and the gameworld is very detailed and varied.

"I played the original Everquest and really liked it, but so far I'm liking Everquest 2 even more.

What I've noticed so far is that there is no ""cheating"". No one can steal your mobs or loot, there is limited powerlevelling since those outside your group can't help you except between fights, and if the entire group is working on a quest everyone gets credit for it rather than the first person to grab the quest item.

The graphics are amazing, especially compared to the original. Some people have been reporting lag, but I haven't really had any problems.

Questing is much improved from the original. The quest journal is very concise and helpful in finding what you're looking for. Also, the quest rewards seemed geared for use by your player. No more doing a quest only to have it result in getting an item you can't use.

The talking NPC's are a lot of fun and the voice acting is really good. I just wish all of the NPC's could talk.

Other improvements include tracking. Tracking now draws a path onscreen to your target, rather than just a text message indicating the general direction of your target.

What stopped me from giving 5 stars overall is that, so far, all of the classes seem pretty much the same. However, I can't say if that will remain true when I reach the higher levels. Also, inventory holds fewer items than previously.",5.0,B000067A3M,I'm having a great time so far,Video Games

"I was nervous to purchase this game because of some bad reviews that I have read, but I purchased it anyways. I can now say after playing for a few hours that this game is interesting. Yes the camera and controls are very bad at first, but after an hour of playing I was used to them. The thing I don't like about this game is that its unbelievably easy. I don't like when games are impossible but this is way to easy.

With that being said, this game does have some good qualities to it. First, I can actually play it (coming from the recent junk we have received lately, this is a good thing). Second, I am semi-interested in the story, I can tell the developers actually put some time into this.

So if you are reading this you are probably wanting to play this game. Go ahead and give it a try! I would recommend downloading the demo or watching some gameplay before you shell out $60. But coming from me, this is the best game that I have played this year (with the exception of GTA 4 and Mario Kart Wii of course).",4.0,B000R0SS3Y,Too Human...,Video Games

"Remember playing shinobi 3 for the genesis and getting almost halfway through a level? And that do you remember that part in said level where you had to scale a mountain only to find an enemy hiding at the top ready to blast you and your last life back to the title screen?

Yes all that and more is here in the 3ds version.  That might sound none too appealing, but if you're like me and rememeber the satisfaction you got from getting past that annoying enemy and getting to the end to the level you'll love it here too.

This new version of shinobi has solid graphics and puts the 3d capabilities of Nintendo's new machine to great use.  The controls are solid and combat is smooth. A scoring system lets you know how well you did after each level and secret spots keep you moving.

"It's a good thing I don't listen to the reviews of others, good or bad, because I would've missed out on a fun game. I always believe that you have to try things for yourself and not let others manipulate you into their way of thinking because your experience may be different. Don't just jump on the bandwagon because it seems like the best thing to do. I'm not going to go into every detail but I found the game to be fun and entertaining. The first hour or so of the game is kind of boring but then it takes off from there. The graphics aren't as good as they should be for this generation of consoles but they aren't bad either. Some have called this game repetitive but all video games are repetitive, as is life. Some of the most popular video games (Far Cry 4, Horizon Zero Dawn, Nioh, etc...) are repetitive, but it didn't stop people from enjoying them and giving them good reviews. Actually, this game is similar to Far Cry. If you enjoyed playing that then you should enjoy playing this, and Far Cry was repetitive.

"I like this game, although it puzzled me a little when I started playing - what kind of game is it?

At its core, IMO NMS isn't a 4X game. Or a space simulator. It isn't really even a traditional space trader or combat game. And although exploration is key, it isn't really a true space-ex game. And it's not a ""find Waldo with a scanner"" game, even though you often feel it is, when the one species you haven't identified on the planet is more endangered than the dodo or the great auk. And even though you do a lot of mining, that activity isn't the definitive core of the game either.

So what is NMS?

Instead, I think NMS is the ultimate casual game. Yes I know its incredibly repetitive and limited in scope but I find the rinse-and-repeat gameplay strangely soothing. It's not cerebral by any means (even the puzzles are simple) but it's low challenge level means that you can easily play it while listening to some good music on Spotify and just zone out to the golden-age-of-sci-fi vibe.

In fact, I haven't played any of my usual go-to casual games since I got my hands on NMS on launch day, and that's saying something.

tl;dr: NMS is like Minecraft in Space meets Bejewelled meets Myst meets Ace Combat and they all have a baby with Spore. I like it a lot.",4.0,B00ZQB28XK,Frankengame...,Video Games

"In the video game world, it's not such a great idea to mix celebrities with software...don't ask why.  The 80's band, Journey, had their on video game, along with Wu Tang Clan's ""Wu Tang: Shaolin Style"" fighting game, and then there's Aerosmith's God-awful ""Revolution X"" shooing gallery game, that was so frustrating and the music was so horrible, that you wanted to stick ball-point pens in your eyes and ears!!!  Flash forward to 2002, where THQ tries to compete with it's opponent Konami's ""Dance Dance Revolution"" arcade hit, by staging a celebrity dance battle.  And putting who as the host?  None other than Pop-singer super-star, Britney Spears.
In THQ's ""Britney's Dance Beat"", players will get the opportunity to play a back-up dancer for Britney's upcoming tour.  The idea puts migrane through my head just thinking about it.  Many people have mixed reactions to Spears' taste in music and style...many think she'll be the next Madonna or Janet Jackson, while others think she's just a teenage girl, who pronces around in a Bra and thong with a snake and declares ""I'm a Slave 4 U"", lip-syncing to the words. The propagnda states ""Live out your Fantasies, becoming a back-up dancer for Britney Spears!!!"".  First of all, most peoples fantasies (mostly guys) about Britney aren't about ""Dancing"" with her. This is the type of video game for people that even like disapointting themselves in their own fantasies!  Now, I'm not saying this was a bad game.  Actually, it was pretty entertaining,for people that don't have ""Dance, Dance"". You pick from a selecton of dancers and go through try-outs.  If you succeed, you become a back-up dance for her next concert.  But there is some competiton from other dancers.  In due time through out the game, you unlock secret videos and concert clips, that are at least somewhat intresting, being that you're probably out of breath from the jumping you had to do (the game is compatible with Sony's Dance pad for PSone) or thumb cramps from the constant pushing you had to exicute.  You pretty much dance to every song she does, including ""I'm a Slave 4 U"", ""Oops, I did it again"", ""Stronger"" and others.

PROS

Simple controls.

The environment is awesome (the sun sets and rises, rain, etc).

Missions do not have to be done.

CONS

I personally do not like killing cops and in this game you have to kill a lot of cops.

Graphics are dated (but still good).

"I really tried to not like this game. I was part of the Star Wars fans hoping that Star Wars the Old Republic (SWTOR) to be my new World of Warcraft (WOW) MMO gameplay addiction. However, after it's bitter defeat to the free to play model, I was proven once again nothing will be ever as good as WOW. And the sad part is I'm a year sober from WOW, because 6 years of the same game I've played and paid for, enough is enough. In the past, I completely hated the original Guild Wars. Hated everything to how it's played to the end game, UI and control scheme, and the severe lack of MMO variety. The only thing that I held respect for it was the buy software, play online for free model and the stand alone expansion idea. Over the past couple of years, I got sick of reading about the sequel's hype comments from user forum posts and other threads on various game websites. Well, they weren't lying, because Guild Wars 2 (GW2) completely delivers.

What you get for a $59.99 and NO later subscription fees is a complete breath of fresh air to the Massively Multiplayer Online market. I've played almost 40 hours of the game with a level 14 Asura elementatlist, 42 Norn warrior, and a 10 Sylvari thief. It doesn't seem like much and I'm sure I probably would be level 60 or above if I focused on one character, but GW2 has so much inside of it.

The most notable feature is how you quest. No more running to an area filled with!'s,?'s, or Triangles above NPCs and doing fetch, retrieve, and backtracking to them. Each quest has its own variety involving the area you run into, and provide multiple ways of completion. No more ""filled quest logs,"" because each one is tied to the area they reside. All of them are public, meaning anything you hit and loot among other players become your own. You get XP for helping somebody kill something, and you don't even have to be in their party to do it! No more having to wait for something to spawn and getting frustrated because another player claiming that one item or killing that one NPC you needed for quest completion. Crafting material gathering is also in this same category! Everybody can hit the same node and receive the materials (also random bonuses) and XP they need. Cooperation and public are key word to GW2's level grind. Much like Warhammer Online's Public quests, there are a wide variety of dynamic world events where it just involves players showing up to and the area and helping each other get the job done...except GW2 does it better! There have been countless times other players and I completely drop what we were doing to run to the announced area and assist each other in a world event. Some of these can be small and then have a larger scale depending on what you are doing. I read that later on they become bigger and more epic in scale for later levels. Other players can even help you in your profession (class) story quests. Speaking of these, your profession's story quests can actually be branched out depending on choices you make. Near level 30, the player is tasked with deciding between 3 orders to serve, the Priory, the Vigil, and the Whispers. So to get the most out of Guild Wars 2, play at least 3 characters. If PVE is not your total thing and you don't like grinding levels to get to endcap PVP, then don't worry. You can do PVP to level up by partaking in WVW, where you are scaled to 80 with your current gear and skill unlocks, or structured objective PVP, where you character is scaled to 80 with high teir PVP gear and all skill unlocks....I think. I've only done a small bit of WVW, so don't quote me on that.

Oh, another thing I hated about the first GW, you couldn't jump! It's almost as if the developers went crazy and added all of these vistas and plat forming jumping area puzzles to say ""we're sorry."" The game rewards you more for completely discovering areas. Finding all of the Points of interest, vistas, skill challenges, waypoints and completing all quests reward you with actually good random items. Not some title, and a tabard but useful items, like stones to transmogrify gear, bank/trading post conveniences, XP boosters, and coins to craft high level gear to name a few I've received.
The second most notable feature is that the presentation of GW2 is through the roof. From the character creation screen, viewing the races' intro videos, then to your first steps into visually pleasing environments; GW2 does not hold anything back. Yes, there isn't a pretty CGI cut scene to explain and introduce the world of Tyria to the player, but who really needs them!? The art scheme and design of everything for this game can be described like a beautiful watercolor painting. It truly is a work of digital art on an epic landscape scale. The character models and their animations are purely awesome. Unlike SWTOR, when you pick a race, YOU PICK A RACE and not some copy N paste with little difference of one character model. From the small floppy eared Asura, to the huge bulky Charr, or even the actual plantlike and unique Sylvari; all 5 races of GW2 are unique to each other. The dynamics of the UI astounded me of all of the different effects happening around the screen be it buffs, combat state, diving in water, and etc.  Combat animations, something that is plaguing WOW for years, are not bland what so ever. Spells and melee combat simply flourishes with amazing presentation. Even while swimming in water, there are unique underwater combat animations to the aquatic weapons you yield. What about the Sound and music of GW2? No sound in this game is below 11. The legendary Jeremy Soule, composer for the Elder Scrolls games, once again knows how to serenade the player with beautiful music depending on what area and player state. All races either male or female have wonderful voice actors that have a surprising amount of dialogue be it in combat, emote, or storyline quest cut scenes.
Now, right here is the one feature that is really making it hard for me to reconsider re-subscribing to WOW again: GW2's skill based combat. Instead of choosing a class and being tied to down to obvious restrictions involving skills through a level grind, GW2 introduces weapon based skills.  At first I was scared that the basic Torchlight/Diablo 3ish action bars, But then I discovered this: Depending on what weapons your character can wield, a different skill set is presented for each. For example:  A warrior can use a rifle, does that mean he's not as effective with it? HELL $#%&ING NO! A new set of skills pop up and depending on how you build the character; it's another example of effective DPS. At level 7 you unlock weapon swapping. So that warrior I mentioned could switch from their rifle, to their 1 handed/off hand, or 2 handed weapon for close quarters combat with a press of a button. The ""mage class"" the elementalist, can switch out his/her staff and duel wield daggers with completely different skills set that have completely different effects. Also, there is no designated ""holy trinity"" of the basic group design. No more designated tank, healer, and dps classes, BECAUSE EVERYBODY CAN DO IT. If a fight gets too hard, back out, heal up, switch weapons, and try something else. It is literally up to the player how they want to play their game. The only real choice is what weapons to bring to the fight.

There are many other awesome features in GW2 that that I could talk about, but this review is already long enough.  However, this review can't be complete without some negatives.

1.  The first and obvious one is that you need a pretty good computer to view/play this game. The low settings provided turn the game into a fuzzy mess that really doesn't look...well it looks like Dark Age of Camelot to be honest.  But no matter what, expect lots of visual lag when you are doing WVW PVP.

2.  PVP: On WVW, one of the main marketed features of GW2 is very huge and dynamic. I mean there are 3 servers fighting each other on a huge scaled map. No matter what PC you have, expect LOTS and LOTS of visual lag due to the player count and the nonstop combat effects on the battlefield. This kind of hurt WVW to me, because it turns into a giant clustercuss fast. It's nice you can participate in WVW PVP at level 2, be level capped with other players, but right now it's pretty overbearing. I have not done that much of it. I like the idea, but the lag fest and mayhem made me want to go back into the PVE more. This is literally Alterac Valley on Venom...WOW and Batman fans would get that reference.

3.  I'm not really sure how successful the Auction House, or Black Lion Trading post is. For one, you can't initial trade with players. You have to use mail to trade. The trading post can be accessed anywhere your player is to sell items, but it can be laggy at times. And I know this may affect some players' views on game economy, there really isn't a ""pay to win"" situation parse, but you can purchase game currency through this.

4. Speaking of game currency, mentioned before, this game is the buy software, play online for free model.  So there will be restrictions to it because of the non-wide array of server support most AAA MMOS have. When you pick a server, that's it. It becomes your home.  You only have 5 character slots to choose. If you want more, you have to buy from Arena.net's website. Want more bank and inventory space, got to buy it from them.

5. New players to GW2 and even other MMO veterans will feel lost at some point. The game does have some tutorial sections and a help option, but nothing in your face telling you how to perform actions like crafting. I had to go to youtube to figure out where and how I begin crafting. But most of the time, issues like this become minor nuisances after you figure it out. The maps are very detailed, but almost too cluttered. Grouping with players might actually be more difficult to locate each other, because the light blue dot can get overshadowed by a map's many icons. There is also the overflow issue for the current server populations loads. Overflow is actually a nice tool allowing you to play the PVE game anytime during a server queue. But for grouping, it can be a nuisance to be in the same queue as your party member.

6. (updated) The dungeons can be a clustercuss, especially if you are melee. I was labeled the obligatory ""u bad"" by my fellow party members because a boss fight scenario was literally hard for me to tell what's going on. Usually if the target/boss is going to do something area effect wise, a red circle appears as a warning where the area is going to be affected. With the dodge mechanic, one would simple dodge,...however each of the 5 professions in a dungeon group have flourishing effects with their skills. These, at first spectacular animations, do make things difficult to recognize what's going on; especially having the ranged and hybrid professions in your party. In WVW, it only gets worse. I love the design of the ability animations, but no matter what players will say, the fights in dungeons can just be wipe fests. Try a fight where there are more then one NPC to kill and red circles keep popping up. These dungeon encounters can start interesting then result with aggravation when your heaviest attacks are melee based and you are constantly dodging red circles (if you can see them)all the time. The good thing is you can respawn and run back to the fight from a nearby waypoint without the boss encounters locking you out or resetting. If any player in your party criticizes you claiming that ""well, I can see them, and I have 0 problems, you just bad"" comments, they are usually the ranged professions and have not played something mostly melee yet. I strongly suggest to group with players you know personally and use some sort of voice communication. I've done the 3 dungeons that my current level allows me to enter, and all of them have been exactly what I described. I appreciate Arenanet's ""to differentiate from"" approach with dungeons, but these so far only gave me headaches instead of enjoyment.

This game has more inside its $59.99 package that meet the eye. I apologize for adding yet another long review to amazon, but there is so much to explain about GW2. For example, how easy it is to organize your crafting materials at crafting stations, banks, or through the hero menu. It's simply another example of the positives outweighing the negatives, much like a Charr and Asura on a titter totter; it's that grand. Classic Everquest and World of Warcraft MMO veterans really need try this game out. I'm pretty sure even the nit pickiest MMO game player would find something unique to it. To really explain GW2, is to simply play it yourself and try out the 3 ways to build your character: PVE, PVP, or simply exploring. This version of Tyria may not be the cup of tea to most, but for those seeking something new to the MMO market, Guild Wars 2 raises the bar in combat, exploration, and just pure immersion... and with no subscription fee!",4.0,B001TOQ8X4,"The Perfect Example ""Buy Software, Play Online for Free"" MMO",Video Games

It has good games and stuff, but the Genesis ports sound like something that would be on the Master System. When a 16 bit game sounds like an 8 bit game, you know you have a problem. It seems like all the work went into the only two games that weren't Genesis games. Virtua Cop 2 was perfectly ported from the Sega Saturn, and Sega Swirl is primarily a Dreamcast game.

Another major flaw is that if you want to change the game, you have to reboot the Dreamcast. It gets annoying.

It says that each Genesis game was test played, but if it was, IT WOULDN'T SOUND LIKE NES, and the switching games thing is a problem that Sega had since the first compilation on the Genesis, the Sonic compilation.

"I applied the protector to the bottom screen without much trouble. This protector works perfectly! I can't even tell that it's there, and the touch sensitivity is just as great as before!

The top screen, on the other hand, was really difficult to apply. Since it covers the entire top half of the 3DS, it's just too big to be able to put on without getting some kind of dust or bubbles under it. I eventually gave up and decided to just use the bottom protector. That's the more important one anyway, since that's the touch screen.

In reply to some of the other reviews on here, these protectors arrived in perfect condition, with no scratches or anything. All stickers and labels were exactly as they should be.

If the top protector was just big enough to cover the top screen, instead of the entire top half, I would have rated this 5 out of 5.",3.0,B004KPYEHQ,Bottom Screen: Perfect! Top Screen: Too difficult to apply,Video Games

"The product that was shipped to me was different than described. The sword is plastic, not foam, and none of the fancy decals that make it look nice exist. The shield has a blank spot on the front where stickers should go but even the box that it shipped it shows no decal.

I would be fine with the looks, accept the product hinders gameplay. The camera needs to see the glowing orb in its entirety in order to work properly. The sword, when thrust forward or swung forward, blocks the camera's view of the glob so that the motion in the game becomes jittery. I tried using the bow and my character would only aim at the ground or it would twitch around uncontrollably. As soon as I removed the bow I was killing hordes of enemies like Legolas.

"The past couple months it seemed like all the hype was on the upcoming COD Black Ops game. This Medal of Honor game came out about a month prior to Black Ops. I thought it would be a good warm-up for COD, but it is every bit as good as Black Ops. I do not play these games online, preferring to just enjoy the first person shooter time by myself as a way to relax from the daily stresses of work, so I do not know how this game is to play online, but I thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of Medal of Honor. I had talked to some people that were not going to buy Medal of Honor, instead saving their money to purchase Black Ops. Having purchased both Medal of Honor and Black Ops before they were released, if I had to choose only one of those games to endorse, I would have a difficult time choosing between the two.

"Not much point in adding another 5 star review here, but figured I would do it anyway... For anyone that has ever played one of these turned-based 2D strategy games (FF Tactics, Tactics Ogre, Disgaea, Shining Force series, etc.), this may be the best one ever made.  I am usually bored to tears by stories in RPGs and skip through them as fast as possible, but this one is succinct and compelling enough to keep me interested without getting bored.

The battle system, probably simpler than FFT, is still pretty deep.  Most characters are lumped into a ""job"" of sorts, mostly distinguished by their weapon (2-H axe-weilders are strong, lots of HP, but slow, 1-H sword users are faster, more versatile, but not as powerful, etc.).  Characters are customizable by skill slots (up to 6 by the end of the game).  The game is difficult, especially early on, without being cheap.  As I got about 2/3 of the way into it, I started doing a lot of the ""extra"" battles, which leveled my characters and made the storyline battles quite a bit easier, but the battles were still fun.

The only complaint I have is a forced missed character.  At one point in the story you have to choose between two paths, and depending on which path you take you get 1 of 2 characters.  You can never get the other without a second play through.  These gimmicks for the sake of ""replay value"" bug me, since at this point in my life I usually can't get through a game once, much less twice.

Overall great game.",5.0,B000R37S78,really really good,Video Games

"I bought this game for two reasons.  The first reason is that I love puzzle games.  The second reason is because I wanted a way to compete with my husband! This game delivers on both counts.  You can store up to 4 files on the game which track the daily progress and Brain Age of each player. (It also has a Quick Play option for people who don't want to track their progress.)  It can also compare graphs of the results for each player so you can really tell how well you're doing compared to to other people using the game.
 The game gives you three tests to determine your ""brain age.""  My only complaint about the game is that one test involves saying colors but the game is extremely picky when recognizing the word ""blue"" which can be frustrating.
 After you've tested your brain age, then you can choose from a series of activities which ""train"" your brain.  The more you use the game, the more activities become available.  I've only had the game a week and so far I can choose from doing a series of either 20 or 100 simple math problems, reading aloud, a game called Low to High which requires memorizing numbers in a series, syllable count, and a game called Head Count where you must keep track of people moving rapidly in and out of a house.  The game tracks your daily progress of this and tells you how you're doing.  At the end of each activity you are told whether you did it at walking, bicycle, car, train, jet, or rocket speed.  So far the games are fun and take only minutes to get through.
 This game also comes with Sudoku puzzles which are tracked separately from the daily ""brain training.""  It gives tips on how to do the puzzles and has various levels of difficulty.  I did not know how to do Sudoku puzzles before I bought the game but have learned from playing it.  Admittedly, I'm still on the basic puzzles and have not logged in very impressive times on them!
  My [...] son likes playing this game but overall I wouldn't recommend it for children under the age of 10.  The game says that 20 is the ideal brain age so it isn't accurate for people under 20.  My son usually comes out with a brain age of 50 or 60.  The math puzzles require knowing the multiplication tables and reading aloud requires a pretty good vocabulary. (So far the reading material has been excerpts from 18th and 19th century literature.) This would make the game nearly impossible or incredibly frustrating for kids under a certain age.
  Needless to say, the sound and graphics aren't state of the art on this game but it's not really what the game is about. If you like puzzles or are just looking for a game that doesn't take too long to play and is easy to learn then you might enjoy this.",4.0,B000EGELP0,Fun and addictive,Video Games

"This review speaks to both Rome and Barbarian Invasion. There are some differences, but the gameplay is essentially the same.

I'm a long time fan of strategy war games going all the way back to the first Strategic Conquest game by Delta Tao.  I love every flavor of Civilization, from Sid Meier's to Stardock, and games like Stronghold.  So, I was looking forward to playing Rome because I thought it had elements of all of those classics.  And it does.  You have to build and maintain cities, raise armies and duke it out on the battlefield.

But it just didn't grab me.  Not in the way those other games did.  For one thing, I never could figure out what made one city a happy cash cow and another city a money pit full of pissed off plebes.  It seemed to have more to do with population than with infrastructure or tax rates (certain buildings give moral bonuses; higher tax rates make people unhappy).  It just seemed kind of random.  The only way to conquer a city and not have a riot on your hands for ten terms seemed to be to enslave the population or exterminate them.  Me, I don't even like to step on a Sim Ant when I can avoid it.

I played Rome: Total War through one time as the Romans and Barbarian Invasion through three times; once as the Saxons, once as the Romans and once as the Horde...actually I never finished the Horde game.  I was just over it by that point.

So, as with most games, it's going depend on what the player enjoys and the sort of game they like to play as to whether or not Rome is for you.  By this point, the game is old enough where you can find it fairly cheap on E-bay or Amazon, so it's worth checking out.  I think part of my problem was reading all these rave reviews, I had big expectations that weren't quite satisfied.  Hope you get more out of it.",3.0,B000E2D3LC,It was okay.

"This game really did get hyped up beyond belief.  There are well over 1,000 cars in the game, but here's the thing, less then 200 are the new ""premium"" models which have the fully detailed interiors and exteriors.  It's already been said on countless websites that they took the old models from Gran Turismo 4, and just gave them a higher resolution and basically copied them over to GT5.

Now that we got that out of the way you will only like GT5, if you liked the past GT games.  Nothing new has really changed, other than the graphics really.  Weather effects are really cool when driving through the rain.  I could stare at the rain/windshield wipers all day long because it looks so real.  The game played at 1080p which is also a plus.

Some things I wasn't real big on was even after installing almost 8GB of data during the install, the game still takes a long time to load.  You would think with an install that big, most things would be instant. This is a racing game after all.  Not some open world adventure game.  Like I said earlier about the car count, another con is a majority of cars you are going to be playing with won't have the nice detailed interiors.  You can buy cars at the ""used dealership"" in the game but for the most part I think they are all the standard cars.  You will be doing a lot of buying from there since that is where you buy the older cars that certain races need.  There is also the ""new car"" dealership that carries the premium models but the selection isn't that big.
Another con I have is the way the menu's and overall game is set up.  Certain things take forever to do.  Lets say you want to wash your car.  Once you get to the option you have to sit through like a 10-15 second animation of people washing your car.  Same with changing the oil.  It may not seem like a complaint, but after spending so much time with the game and dealing with countless menu's and loading times, i'd rather just skip any extra animations and get back on my way to playing the game.

I'm going to wrap this up by saying, if you have always hated the older Gran Turismo games, this game will not change your mind.  I did have fun with it in small doses but overall it needs some work.  If you are in the mood for a ""fun"" racing game, this game may not be for you.  It's all about realistic driving and making the best times around a lap.  You may want to stick with Burnout or Need For Speed Hot Pursuit if you are looking to get some fun, less time consuming, racing done.",4.0,B002BSA1C6,More Of The Same,Video Games
Unfortunately I can't help but come to the conclusion that the Create Mode in the game is a failure. There are just too many glitches and frustration involved. It takes an UNGODLY amount of time to put anything together and then you're lucky if 10 or 15 people play it before it gets buried under newer levels and no one plays it again. The final straw for me was the other day when I spent hours working on a level and saved it TWICE to be safe. When I came back to the game I found neither saves had taken and I was back to square one. One other time a level I was working on just failed to load and I lost it.

"Those who played this (or any other SS game) more than once in arcades will love it. New(er) generation of gamers may not.

This is a direct port from the NEOGEO platform. Graphics prove it. They are easily the worst thing in the game. Controls are very smooth and responsive (I gave up playing SF Aniv. Ed. because of its horrible controls). Gameplay is much more advanced then I remember from SS and SS2. Most of the original characters are present, plus a whole bunch of new ones, some good some bad. Sound is a marginal improvement over the previous titles and some character noises are downright annoying. The Arcade mode starts out pretty easy, but gets more difficult after first three challenges.

"When it comes to the third instalment you will need to think what kind of changes could there be to keep people going with the series. This is particularly true for Project Zero / Fatal Frame cos the whole novelty of the Camera Obscura should have worn out by now. It won't be an easy job to keep players to continue with the series if Tecmo can't make it interesting. However, Tecmo once again did a brilliant job with third game in the series.

For people new to the series, it is a survival horror using a camera as your only weapon to survive the nights. As a result the adventure is split between first and third person view. You explore in the third person view but battle in the first person view. The control seems clumsy at the beginning but once you understand the logic then it is very intuitive. The camera functions are more or less the same with the last two games but this time round the difference made is instead of playing as one character, you play as 3 different character using the same yet different cameras. As a result when the story force you as another character, you have to readjust the skills, reaction time and the abilities of the cameras. Upgrade points are shared among all 3 characters, which makes decisions for upgrading a very strategic part of the game. Since the battles are in first person view you will need to switch between the two views regularly as though you can move around in the first person view, ghosts don't just stay inside your frame for you. This could be annoying when it comes to really fast ghost that even come up from the ground.

Story wise, it closely ties into the first two games and even one of the characters is from the first game. So when you play as her you feel like you relive the first game's nightmare while at the same time new uncertainties comes in. The familiarity factor works really well, though it resembles the tactic used in Eternal Darkness on the GameCube. Also the story in this game further explained certain things in the first and the second game, making the play through more rewarding as you will want feel like ""wow it's because of this that things happened in the first and second games were like that!"" It's a cleverly written plot.

Some of the cut scenes are brilliantly done and can give you shock from time to time. Even subtle things happened in the game and the appearance of enemies can make you shiver too. It's a game best played with lights off to feel the tension. The vibration function works really well as whenever the controller vibrates, you have to think whether it's an enemy or just an event to record. That puts further tension in the gameplay.

In all, Project Zero 3 / Fatal Frame 3 is a game well worth to check out and spend your time on. You will find finishing the game very rewarding and satisfying.",5.0,B0009UC6AI,As Thrilling As Ever,Video Games

"Errr, that's in regard to FF7 and on.
This game is AWESOME!
This game plays like a movie, much in the same as Metal Gear Solid2. What's that mean? There are cutscenes/CGI movies galore and in the end, it is very difficult to distinguish from the movies and in-game play. The graphics are that darn good! In fact, the power of the PS2 (and the DVD format) is showing just how great a game Square can make. No longer is the archaic technoloy of the PSX stoping them!
That's just graphics. Control is tight, the characters are excellent, and the story is intriguing. Square put a lot of thought and energy into this game, moreso than I've noticed from the past 3.
At 1st look, I can understand how some gamers might hold back because of the last couple of stinkers. The characters are human again, like FF8. The primary character, Tidus, is a blitzball player. While a sport in an RPG might sound distracting or just plain dumb, it really looks awesome in motion. Tidus is a teenager and very much acts like it. Yuna, the summoner, is slowly getting into her role. Lulu, the resident sorceress, does a good job of being a pill. Wakka is great fun (maybe stereotypical Hawaiian or Samoan) and exudes a light heartedness in what is a fairly dark game. Auron acts as a mentor and Rikku is kind of a Selphie/Yuffie combination. Why do I spend time on the characters? Because the story can be solid, but if the characters stink, the game will be poor.
This is not like the old FF games where it's knights in shining armor. It's not like FF7 with a futuristic apocalyptic world. Maybe a bit more like FF8, but way better.
The new magic system might seem goofy, but I'm really liking it. The in-game tutorials aren't as annoying as most. In fact, the tutorials are a part of the game, which is very nice. The menu is easy to navigate. The battle system is now turned-based, rather than that horrible Active Battle Meter. The greatest addition is being able to bring in unused characters during a battle!
What can I compare this game to? It's has elements of Star Trek:TNG, Matrix and Chrono Cross/Trigger. (I'm not far enough into it to be concrete about this one) Time seems to be playing a role. But I can't tell if Tidus is hopping from dimension to dimension, in time, OR altered reality.  As you get even further into the game, there are some major plot twists.  Some you can see coming, others leave your head spinning.
I firmly believe that THIS is THE game for which you would buy a PS2. Like FF7 bringing in millions of new game players, FFX is setting another standard.
Are you still in doubt? Go rent Final Fantasy the movie DVD and watch the preview for this game. That alone will make you more than interested and excited.

"Max Payne is the best third-person game ever. The PC version is the best version, that is for sure, quite frankly i'd take a keyboard over a controller anyday. Max Payne is a really, really long game, why people said the game was short is beyond me. Graphically it is pretty average, the character models are terribly ugly and the faces just look cut & pasted on the characters. Also, the one thing i always find amusing about Rockstar games is that no matter who develops the games for Rockstars, you can pull any weapon out of your pockets, no matter what size, that makes me laugh.
This game is almost like watching a full blown movie. I loved the way they told the story, almost like a comic book, which is really cool. Bullet-time is also a nice feature, for a video game that was really original and almost every game has tried to copy it since.

"These are a great option if you are looking for an inexpensive gaming headset but don't want to pay the premium price for name brands, but it's not without a few hiccups.

First of all, they were packaged well and arrived in perfect condition. But you do need to make sure you are aware of what you are getting. For full functionality, you will need to buy these with the separately-sold headset adapter wires. The headphones alone only include a splitter for the input/mic wires. Even though it says ""Xbox"" right on the box, without the adapter cables, you can't natively connect these to an Xbox 360. If you have a newer Xbox One controller, or the Xbox One stereo headset adapter attachment, you can natively use this on an Xbox One. If you have a PS4, all those controllers accept a standard 3.5mm input, so you'll be good there too. But Xbox 360/PS3 will need the extra adapter wires. PC depends on what functionality you want. You can use the standard included cables on PC, but as with all of them, the extra adapter set gives you USB support and in-line adjustable mic/game volume.

If you do get the adapter cables set with this, you'll pretty much be prepared for anything. But with this compatibility freedom comes a prerequisite of holding a master's degree in electrical engineering. Look at the wiring diagram picture I posted to this review for an example setup for Xbox 360. It's kind of crazy; wires everywhere. It's not really too bad to figure out if you follow the diagram, but it does mean you need to conquer your fear of wires if you are used to wireless solutions. On the plus side though, no built-in batteries to recharge and worry about becoming obsolete in a couple years.

The sound quality on these is surprisingly good for unpowered headphones this cheap. They provide a good full range of sound, which is much better than any other headset I've tried in this price range (though you shouldn't expect them to outperform higher-end ones).

I love the style, it seems they borrowed a lot of elements from Steelseries Siberia headphones, which I also own. The adjustable headstrap works well, and the mic is easily adjustable.

The only negative on the comfort factor is the ears are a little bit skewed to a forward tilt. What I mean by that is, they do not sit flush over my ears, because the rear end of them is lifted up from behind my ears. I keep trying to gently bend them back a little bit, but they are not built to be adjustable in this direction, so they just go right back after I take my hands off them. This is too bad because the sound quality is so much better with a sealed, firm connection. You lose a lot of the lower range of sound without a good, close seal. So while I'm very impressed with the sound quality as I press them against my ears, it degrades sharply as I take my hands off them and they tilt forward again, breaking the seal (and becoming less comfortable).

*Summary*

Pros:
[+] Seriously great value at this low price point
[+] Excellent style (blatant copy of Siberia Elites?)
[+] Sound and mic quality are well above my expectations for the price range
[+] Compatible with nearly everything when purchased with adapter cables set
[+] Even without adapter cables, compatible with PS4 & newer Xbox One controllers out of the box
[+] Adjustable headband makes these comfortably fit most head sizes

[-] Earcups are skewed forward a bit, so they don't have a flush fit on my ears

"Destiny has some pretty big shoes to fill. With it's pedigree consisting of Bungie, the team behind the cultural monolith that is the Halo series, along with Activision pouring upwards of $500 million dollars into advertising, it's tough to remove one's self from the sheer hype surrounding the title. Can destiny possibly deliver on that hype?

The short answer is no. If you come into the experience hoping it will be the next halo, you'll be sorely disappointed.

That's not to say Destiny is a bad game by any means. The gunplay is solid and the art direction is wonderful. Unfortunately though, I don't foresee this game having much staying power beyond a weekend or two, as there simply isn't enough substance here to really push you to play beyond those initial 20 hours or so.

For starters, there isn't much respite from the incredibly repetitive missions. Pretty much every mission involves touching down on a planet, walking or riding to a instanced area, and then slowly pushing forward through waves of samey enemies until you reach a waypoint, where you hold down a button and your ""ghost"" companion gives you some vague or nonsensical plot information entirely through speech. At which point, you return to your ship so you can do it all again (But not before sitting through up to a full minute of loading screens). I've played for 20 hours so far and I have yet to play through a mission that deviates from this structure.

The levels themselves are beautiful and wide open, and you can often find loot boxes in little alcoves off the beaten path, so traversing them can actually be quite fun. Unfortunately you'll be visiting the same ones over and over and over again. The landscapes are otherwise fairly sparse of actual gameplay, besides the occasional firefight, so revisiting the areas often leads to them feeling rather lifeless once you peel back the beautiful exterior.

This is all tolerable when you are playing with friends, as the game encourages you have 2 other people in your fire-team. But if you are alone, the completely milquetoast missions and sparse gameplay will start to grind on you and you'll likely lose interest fast.

Speaking of multiplayer, it can be a bit of a mixed bag. There isn't really any sort of chat outside the 3 people in your fireteam, which is somewhat puzzling considering the obvious multiplayer focus. There also doesn't seem to be any sort of matchmaking for those who only want to play PVP, which is a bit surprising considering this is the team that made Halo for crying out loud.

I've been focusing on the negatives in this review, and that may not be entirely fair. The gunplay is actually very satisfying and the sound design is superb. Everything just feels right and has the appropriate impact. If you can get a group of 3 people together to romp through some missions and then get a group together to play some PvP, there is certainly a satisfying experience to be had here. If you're just looking for a good FPS multiplayer experience to break in your PS4 at a time where there isn't that much of a selection, I have no reservations recommending Destiny, because it is actually a solid title with a lot of graphical and gameplay polish.

But if you're coming at the game expecting it to be the next Halo, or are planning on playing it alone, I'd say this is safe to pass on.",3.0,B00BGA9Y3W,A solidly 3-star experience,Video Games

"Every since Mortal Kombat came out, it was a delight to see a game with blood, violence, but best of all, FATALITIES. As the series got more popular, more and more characters got added to the list with more and more secrets to learn and find. Now, in todays age, you can get the complete set of the first 3 games as a packaged deal for a very low price. The only version that they still need to update or fix is Mortal Kombat Trilogy, but that's another story.

The game series itself is very well setup. You can choose which game you can play and then from there choose your character and see how much you know from your experience. The games play is not bad and sound could use a little more work. For $10 for all 3 games, you can't go completely wrong. My major issue is the following...

You do have to have a STEAM account, as well as a ""Games For Windows/Windows LIVE"" account. The reason for the ""Games For Windows/Windows LIVE"" account is so you can input the serial that STEAM will provide you with once the game activated on STEAM first. (Hope you followed that closely, but wait, it gets worse) Now, with that said, I should also warn you, there are issues with this game because of the 2 accounts you have to have. If you install the game and you can't get past the ""PRESS ENTER"" intro screen, you are in for some frustration. Here is how you will have to handle this issue from what I have read from some forums on steam and other gaming sites...

1.) Activate game on the STEAM account
2.) Install the game on your PC
3.) If you run the game and can't get past the ""PRESS ENTER"", do the following
4.) Uninstall any/all ""Games For Windows/Windows LIVE"" applications on your PC (Including the extra Apps)
5.) Reinstall ""Games For Windows/Windows LIVE""
6.) If during the install, it shows you had something else already still installed, you have to uninstall that to and start over
7.) If you did a complete FRESH install of ""Games For Windows/Windows LIVE"" This should fix the problem
8.) Now, run the game and it should NOW ask you for the serial that STEAM will provide you with

Now, if this does not clear up the problem, I don't know what to tell you. This is how I was able to get this to work for me for I had the same ""PRESS ENTER"" issue like a lot of people have had. Basically, it requires you to have all your original ""Games For Windows/Windows LIVE"" programs installed as well as used for your copy of Windows on your PC.

Overall, the game works great. My only other issue is the Online play (If you can call it that) is not as effective as you might think. Lag issues, slowdown, sometimes even interrupted for whatever reason it will be. Personally, I just have this game for the game itself, not for the online play. So, if you get this game, please make sure you have a ""FRESH"" copy of ""Games For Windows/Windows LIVE"" installed. I have heard that getting the ""Retail"" version is much easier than getting the downloaded copy. Since I didn't get the retail version, I can't say if that is true. Just be ready for a headache when you do purchase the ""Download"" version of this game. Good luck getting this game to work.",3.0,B0093N3Z0M,"Great game for Mortal Kombat Fans, Not so great for STEAM and Windows LIVE accounts...",Video Games

"Note: This review was written as if it was just released

3D platformers are a relatively new gaming genre. Although it didn't start the actual genre, Super Mario 64 is considered the father of 3D platform games and started the craze that led to many imitations and several successful games. 3D platforming stemmed off from the extremely successful, arguably the most of any video game genre, 2D platform gameplay. However, it wasn't as easy as just switching to 3D. Several mechanics had to be changed, such as jumping. Characters didn't just jump straight; characters could jump in any direction. Super Mario 64 acknowledged these problems and worked around them to create one of the most popular and successful sub-genres in all of video game history. I am happy to say that Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy has come very close to perfecting this genre.

What This Game is All About:
 The game is started out by having the player listen to what sounds like an older man questioning the world he lives in and how it came to be. He then starts to say that he feels that the answers are intertwined with a young boys destiny and how this boy is reckless (pfftteenagers). The boy, whose name is Jak, is with his friend Daxter on a boat. They are heading to an island that Daxter claims they weren't supposed to go to. Long story short, they go there, they run into trouble, Daxter gets turned into an Ottsel (a mix between an otter and weasel), they go back to their place, and they end up finding out that the only way to change Daxter back is to find a sage who lives far to the north. So, they begin their adventure.

 The playable character is Jak, with Daxter sitting on his shoulder. In a brief training level, they find out about several items that they must collect: Power Cells, Precursor Orbs, and Scout Flies. Power Cells are the main collectible in the games, similar to the Stars in Super Mario 64. They get these for completing tasks, such as helping a farmer herd his Yakows into his fence to finding one in a secret room that can only accessed with the correct Eco (the games version of power-ups). There are about one-hundred Power Cells in the game. Precursor Orbs are far more abundant (there are two-thousand of these suckers) and are a currency used in the game to obtain Power Cells off of certain characters in the game. Scout Flies are artificial scouting creatures created by one of the protagonists who help them throughout the game. They have been trapped and there are exactly seven in each level; finding all seven will yield one of the many Power Cells. Basically, the characters use these Power Cells to power zoomers (similar to the ones in Return of the Jedi) and cross deadly lava pits or canyons. These are necessary to progress throughout the game. Those are the collectibles of the game, so lets get down to the gameplay.

Gameplay:
 The gameplay is obviously one of the biggest reasons someone may want to play this game. Let me just say, it doesnt disappoint. Being a platforming game, one of the most important functions of the game is the ability to not only jump, but to be able to do it with ease and grace, while still making the player feel in control. It mostly succeeds in that goal. There were a few times when I felt I jumped correctly, but the landing wasn't where I expected it to be, however, those instances were rare and they don't detract from the game. Playing as Jak is also one of the smoothest game experiences ever; he moves so easily and stops as soon as I let go of the analog stick. The game has very responsive controls, to be blunt about it.

 For the mission objectives, they are varied and done with style. One mission had me get ambushed by Lurkers, the main enemy group of the game, while another had me try to defeat a giant, evil plant. Those are the action goals. Others are more platforming focused, such as climbing a huge underground site, with several obstacles and poles to swing from. There are also several minigames, all of which are fun and engaging. One of these minigames had me catching two-hundred pounds of fish for a local fisherman, and it made me focus, but it wasn't frustrating. Another gameplay mechanic is the zoomer and Flut-Flut. The former is what it sounds like and it controls pretty well, but it isn't the best to handle, but that adds to the feel. The Flut-Flut, on the other hand, is a giant, bird-like creature that Jak rides in a similar manner to how Mario rides Yoshi; the bird even has a flutter jump. The bird is probably my favorite aspect of the game, gameplay-wise. It, like Jak, controls very well and it also isn't overused, so it was a treat for the few times I got to use it. Jak must, however, have to complete a certain mission before using it.

 Eco is the games versions of power-ups. They grant Jak temporary powers that can be used to defeat enemies, solve puzzles, and just be awesome. Green Eco heals Jak, Blue Eco gives him speed and access to open/activate certain areas of the game, Yellow Eco allows him to shoot fiery Eco blasts, and Red Eco makes Jak stronger. These different types of Eco are used throughout the game to help Jak on his quest and are really fun to use. As a side note, Dark Eco is bad.

 Despite my almost-complete positive outlook on the gameplay so far, it isn't perfect. As stated above, the jumps don't quite work always, but I feel that way with all platformers, so that may be me and not the game. Also, the camera doesnt always line up correctly, so a few jumps may get missed due to that reason. This next reason isn't really a complaint, but just something that needs to be said: the game doesnt add much new to the platforming category, but just refines several of its attributes.

 There are two ideas that were implemented into the game that, although not noticeable at first, make a huge difference when another game is played. The first idea is that there is almost zero loading. The game has very, very brief loading when the game data is saved and loaded, but that is it. There is no loading between levels, although there are a couple levels that are up a mountain or across water and requires slight waiting. Other than those couple instances, there is no loading. It is a beauty to be able to travel through a seamless, connected world. The game really is just one, big level. It may seem trivial, but the next time that another game is played, Ill remember. There are also warp gates to travel to a previous home-area (they have no enemies and are in the middle of the action levels, as I call them), so the player doesnt have to find a way all the way back.

 The other idea is that when Jak dies, your Ottsel friend, Daxter, says a hilarious comment. These can range from How am I gonna get changed back now! to Hey, Jak! Can I have your insect collection? There are probably a good fifteen of these death scenes and they are extremely funny and can lighten the mood if it felt like a cheap death. Also, whenever Jak gets a Power Cell, Daxter does a funky dance and these are nice to see. There are probably fifteen of these, too.

 Overall, the gameplay is exemplary and does a magnificent job of keeping true to the formula of 3D platformers. It may not be new, but the refinement level is top-notch.

Story:
 The story doesnt get into much detail (most platformers dont), but it has hilarious moments thanks to the character interaction. Daxter is probably one of the funniest video game characters that I have ever seen, and most of the funny scenes involve him in some way. What the game doesnt have in story, it makes up for with witty character dialogue.

Design:
 The worlds are designed in one the most amazing ways possible. This is a living, breathing world. It also shows what the PS2 is truly capable of doing with graphics. These are probably some of the best graphics out there on any video game console, as of 2001.

Sound:
 The sound effects are pleasing to hear and the music is very well done. The music that plays when Jak receives a Power Cell lets the player know that he or she just accomplished something. The level music is also very relatable to the level itself. Im not a music expert, but when I see a green and brightly colored land, I think happy. The game executes music sounding like what a level looks like very well.

Difficulty:
 One of the major qualms that some people may have with the game, is the difficulty. To most people, they would probably find it to be exceptionally easy, especially if they have played several 3D platformers and have become very adept. I didn't have a problem with it, because I felt it fit with the game. It is a very relaxing experience and although platformer masters may not find it appealing, they would be foolish to ignore the game because of that.

Replay Value:
 This is the heart-breaker of the deal. The game is very short. The game could be beaten in less than six hours. I fully beat it in about ten hours and wasn't rushing nor taking in every little detail to the game. I do recommend replaying the game not only because it is great, but because I feel that it would be good for speed-runs, even if that wasn't an intention. It is easy enough for most gamers and could pose a challenge for masters who want extremely fast times. For those who aren't interested, it is still more than worthy for a single playthrough.

Final Judgment:
 This game is RECOMMENDED. Although there are a few gameplay mechanics that irk me at times, they don't detract from the overall experience. It is a short game, but amusement can be found in replaying for speed runs or just because it is enjoyable and downright funny. At the very least, the game should be rented and played through once. Then, a decision can be made on whether it should be bought. I, personally, am happy that what feels like an end to the 3D platforming age is going out with a very high-quality game.

"I was extremely skeptical about getting Zestiria for the longest time after hearing the backlash from Japanese fans with the handling of certain main characters but by the time I got Zestiria when it was selling for cheap I found that there was more than the character problem at hand.

As a long time 'Tales of' fan I felt devastated that the series was never going to make another landing in the west after Vesperia, until the releases of the mediocre 'Graces f' that actually helped the series continue in the west. After a few disappointing releases I was stoked to hear about Zestiria back when it was announced late 2012 when I was sitting in my Marine Biology class. I couldn't wait for this fresh new entry that was going to be ""open world""

I was disappointed by the time I got the game moreso cause it wasn't structured like any of the stellar Tales games I've played notably Abyss & Vesperia, the combat was fine but the rest of the game just felt lazily slopped together. Skits were clumped to save points and it made watching them feel like a waste of your own time and the story never had a striking pivotal moment that most JRPGs do.  The story laid flat on the ground hours after hours and not only that but the characters were never intriguing or held my interest. I gave up on Zestiria after the game made me obligated to backtrack to places for no real reason.

This had to be the most lackluster entry in the series since 'Graces f' and I was extremely disappointed that this game had a Tales name to it and the massive amount of filler content to extend an already short game.

"You don't have to be a gamer to use this mouse.  It is also a good surfing mouse for those who are right handed.

When you take it out of the box it looks massive, but it is well designed and your hand falls naturally into the groves on the top and sides, making it feel smaller in your hand.  In the past when I tried using a big mouse, I had discomfort in my wrist.  For that reason I have long been using a small mouse, travel size, but so far I am comfortable using this mouse.

The buttons on the left side enable you to quickly go back or forward a page, controls my small mouse does not have.  This speeds up surfing. Also, you can easily adjust the sensitivity of the cursor by pressing the DPI button.  There are 5 options:  1000, 1600, 2400, 3200 and 5500.  I am using 3200.  1000 and 1600 seem slow, sluggish, while at 5500 the cursor flies around too fast for my  liking.  The ability to adjust the DPI is also something I have not had on my small mouse so I didn't know what I was missing.

The scroll wheel works well

This mouse is corded, plugged into a USB port on my laptop.  It has been a very long time since I last used a corded mouse, but the cord for this mouse is so long, about 4.5 feet, that you are not restricted  at all.  I forget that it is corded when I am using it.

The mouse is plug and play.  I plugged it in before turning on my computer and it was immediately recognized.  It was ready to use by the time the computer was fully loaded.  There is no software to install and you can't program the buttons.  This may be a problem for some gamers, but should not be a problem for most surfers.

And it brightens up my desk with the flashing colors, something else my small mouse didn't do. You can pick your color from the 5 that flash and have it continue to flash that color, or you can have random flashing colors.  I tried a single color, but went back to random flashing colors because I found that more interesting.

Simple instructions come with the mouse.

I was sent a sample to try and review, but the fact that I didn't pay for the mouse did not influence this review in any way.  It is a good mouse at a very good price (at the time this review is written).",5.0,B00PJRQBHA,A Good Surfing Mouse,Video Games

"Okay, I never played the original ""Guitar Hero"" that started this whole guitar peripheral band game thing.  But I played the second at friends' houses and borrowed it once.  Thought it was pretty great and lots of fun.  But the first I owned was Rock Band with Guitar Hero 3.  And Rock Band really did it for me.  The blaring colors of Guitar Hero were replaced by mellower tones that focused more on the music.  And rather than generic rockers you could make your own guy, which I had fun with.  What finally got me to quit playing it so much was... I started to run out of songs.  I still had some favorites I'd play: Welcome Home, Reptilia, The Hand That Feeds, Afterlife (downloaded), Black Hole Sun.  But other than that there wasn't much left to do.  Other than go through on the drums (boring) or five-star everything on Expert (not interested).

And then here's Rock Band 2.  Basically it's the same thing, but without any of the problems from the first one.  There's new songs and quite a lot of them.  You can make all the characters in your band and play through tour mode with a single player.  Some album information is even given when selecting songs from the list.  And it's still the same great fake guitar playing I loved.

But what really clinched Rock Band for me (and the Guitar Hero games as well) was that it opened up to me so much music...  So many artists that I'd heard of or had heard a few seconds' worth of songs from, but ones I never could give a chance.  A lot of good music is represented here, forcing me to expand my horizons and really get into some stuff I should have liked already.

To sum it up, if you liked the original Rock Band or any of the Guitar Hero games, this is a given.  If you're new to the franchises, this is a fine place to start.

(But you may want to use a Guitar Hero controller if possible.  The puff of the strummer on the Rock Band model doesn't have a very good return spring, so you kind of have to hammer it on those faster songs.  The Guitar Hero controller has a more noticeable click and a fast response so I prefer it.  Some people may think differently, however.)",5.0,B001BX6JUA,Fantastic,Video Games

"I've played several RTS games out there - so I had high hopes for this one.

But let me just say this - if you play in skirmish mode (open maps vs. the computer) - you're probably not going to be able to win anything above easy - because the computer cheats.

And even in the easy mode - the computer doesn't seem to have to follow the same resource rules that you do.

Case in point - I had gotten the computer down to one low ammo resource point - yet it was able to have an unending supply of tanks come in from off screen.

And, as somebody else mentioned - when you start the round, and you only have enough resources for a couple of rifle squads, the computer has already gone through the upgrade tree - and has top of the line tanks.

Personally, I think it's just laziness on the part of Relic to have to resort to the computer cheating in order to create levels of difficulty.

And, as others have mentioned - your unit AI isn't exactly that smart either. You order a unit to attack an enemy unit - and half the time, you unit runs right up to the enemy and starts shooting at them - instead of finding a good spot (or even attacking from where they were when you told them to attack).

The rear of the tank is the weak spot - yet I've watched tanks on my team advance on the enemy backwards - with their weaker rear armor exposed - rather than turning around to face them with their better frontal armor.",3.0,B000FJSIUA,AI cheats in skirmish mode,Video Games

"There is no other game on the Xbox 360 like Fallout 3. The amount of content and the level of detail are unmatched. The gameplay is tight and fluid, and highly rewarding. The graphics are above average; the sound design is spectacular. You won't find better value in a video game than Fallout 3.

I'm going to start this review by saying that I will NOT be comparing Fallout 3 to The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion. While similarities are definitely present, this game trumps Oblivion in every aspect. The only true similarities exist in game engine and developer.

While Fallout 3 may look like a shooter at first (given the perspective and gun wielding nature of the game), it is far from it. Fallout 3 is a 1st/3rd person Action RPG, which means everything you do in the game are based on your stats. Firing a gun and hitting a target is all based on number calculations based on the specific target and your own stats. Many times you will find yourself aiming directly at a target and missing even though your targeting ridicule is directly placed in an enemies face (at a lower level). This may not attract fans of FPSs, so if you play this game expecting an FPS like experience, you will be disappointed until you raise your shooting-based skills. If you play this game like an RPG, the combat is never a bother and actually feels refreshing with all of the turn-based RPGs in today's market.

If you don't know anything about the concept of the game, you may want to read the synopsis/product details on the top of the page, as it pretty much describes the premise of the game. The atmosphere the game provides is incredible, and can be very convincing. The attention to detail in terms of graphics, sound, level/environment design, and even individual object placement will really immerse you in the experience.

Here are the Pros and Cons I have found with this game:

Pros:
- Level of Detail is incredible
- Excellent and convincing voicework/writing
- Amount of content
- Replayability/Multiple Playthroughs Encouraged
- Satisfying combat
- Decisions made really effect the game
- Excellent story
- Highly addicting
- DLC available to extend an already huge experience

Cons
- Some graphical bugs
- Animations (mostly movement) can look strange
- 3rd person view is awful (only use to peek around corners/see what's behind you)
- Highly addicting, can consume several hours of your life

If you haven't gotten the gist of this review by now, I'm pretty much saying that you need to buy this game. If you are one who values your money, and can only afford to buy a few games a year, then this MUST be one of them. If you only buy 1 game this year, you can't call yourself a gamer. Actually, what I meant was if you only buy 1 game this year, make it Fallout 3!",5.0,B000UU3SVI,An Outstanding Game That's Worth Every Penny Spent,Video Games

It is a great way to unwind for an hour or two after a hard day at work, just trying to go through missions as fast as possible.

"I'll admit right off the bat that I'm new to the Soul Calibur series.  This is the first one I've played.  That being said, I am no stranger to fighting games.  When I read about SC4 it sounded like it had so much promise.  What I got seemed kind of just okay.  There are really four things going for SC4: 1)Terrific graphics, 2)Large number of characters, 3)Customized Equipment, and 4) Customized Characters.  Number three is the stand out of the game.  Through purchase and acquisition there are a huge number of equipment and weapon pieces availble in the game.  They let you give your players a very respectible range of abilities.  Couple that with the ability to customize your own character down to their facial features and you get something really great and unexpected in a fighting game.  But all this seems like window dressing.  It's all very pretty but feels of little substance.  The game play is repetitive and the story is really non-existent.  There's nothing that pulls you into the game. It really seems to be an almost XBox Live geared release.  That's where the fun is had.  But strangely the single player game takes up most of the space and feels dull.  $60?  No.  If it was a $20 Xbox Live download I'd be all over it.  My recommendation?

"I must write this review. I have been playing this for a long while. While the game can be fun, it takes WAY to long to get the enjoyable part....
Let me start by saying this, Diablo 3 is great at level 60 hunting down the evils of the world on a hard Monster Power setting.
But it takes forever to get to this point. On top of that there are many disappointments.
1) Content that repeats itself over and over and over (no randomized levels like Diablo 2)
2) Still lacking PVP that was promised....
3) No offline mode
4) Auction House that is pretty much useless for the most part.

.... and many many more.
So wait until the game goes on sale cheap, if you really want to try it. It would possibly be worth that price. Considering that the competition (Torchlight 2) is also 20 bucks... Look up that one to get you through until Diablo 3 goes on sale.",2.0,B00178630A,With a heavy heart....,Video Games

"Okay,  they (Turtle Beach) know there has been a design flaw with their flagship,  headsets for years. I've had the
PX5, XP400, and now the PX51. I'M NOT HARD ON THESE.  I hang them up after every play, and charge them every other night so they don't run out during game play. (I liked putting rechargeable 2 AA batteries in my other two sets, but throw away headsets seem to be the case as with most of the crap made for the US,  instead of made in the US,  to last.) Anyway, back to the flaw design. On the adjustable headset, above where the earcups are attached,  you'll see 4 hex bolts. They fail just above these her bolts. All 3 sets of my headphones,  inside of a year(so that's 3 headsets inside of 3 years)  have all cracked and broke there. I've been fortunate enough to buy a squaretrade warranty,  with each set. (the last two because of prior reviews of these headsets.) These get sent back to turtle beach,  for examination. They have known about this for a couple years, but refused to redesign them.  If you've got a larger head then medium (I'm a 7& 1/2) yours will break to. That is certain.
You can see by the new  Elite 800x, that they have changed the design flaw.

The reason to buy these.  They sound great!  You can hear and enemy reload,  fire off all rounds,  move (footsteps) etc.from all areas; above, below, beside, in front, behind,  plus  left and right. (If l left out any you get my drift.) Try Titanfall to know how you can be attacked from every area possible!

"Let me start by saying that Dragon Age 2 is not a bad game it's just an average game. The problem is when I think of Bioware and RPGs I don't think of average I think of the best. Dragon Age 2 was such a crushing disappointment for many people out there that were in love with Dragon Age: Origins. Most everything that made Origins grand and epic was removed, changed, or gutted in order to shorten the development time needed. Not every change was bad like making combat much more fun for archers and melee characters. Not all removals were bad either like the removal of skill trees which were never very important anyways. I can see what Bioware was trying to do with the game to make it more fun to a larger audience by improving the combat, but the game suffered so much more in other areas.

Origins starts you off on your journey in the race and origin story that does a great job of bring the main plot directly to you very early in the game. You start with knowing who/what your enemy is and then everything from that moment on (including all main sub missions) is directly and clearly related to your struggle against your foe. Dragon Age 2 unfortunately does not give you this sense of purpose. After 15+ Hours of the game I still had no enemy to point to and I couldn't even begin to tell you what the main story was in this game. The game is structured around a bunch of side missions that get extremely repetitive due to the repeating environments and feeling of why am I doing this? When the main story segments kick in they are far too short and far too spread out that they feel like teases. Not until the final hours of the game do you finally get that sense of purpose and a clear enemy. But even then it's far too late and once again over too fast.

'One of the aspects of Origins that was most loved by fans of the original was the sheer amount of depth that the characters had. You could walk up to a character in your camp and engage in some of the most engaging and delightful conversation in gaming history. Each character had a wealth of history and stories to tell. Dragon Age 2 removes this almost completely making the characters speak only when they absolutely must. The characters in DA2 are each unique and well voice acted, but they just don't feel as alive and it's hard to feel as connected to them.

Repeating environments is perhaps the single thing that I disliked most in DA2. There are hundreds of missions in DA2 but each one takes place in one of 5 environments: Cave, Coast, Warehouse, Mountain Area, Street Alley. Let me clarify, I don't mean just a cave or just a warehouse, I mean the exact same warehouse, cave, etc. every time. You go back to the exact same environment for a slightly different quest dozens of times. Not only does do the environments take away from any form of immersion, it makes each quest feel as repetitive as the next since the spawn points are mostly the exact same in each mission. Not to mention the entirety of the game takes place in one lifeless, boring city that had almost no feeling of immersion.

In origins, there were five or so lengthy main story missions that each had a purpose tied to the main plot, unique feel to them, and specially designed environments for each of these missions. When you went on one of these missions, you knew why it was important and how it affects the main story line. Dragon Age 2 decided to throw this concept out the window. Dragon Age 2 took me about 36 hours to finish doing most every mission. 30 of those hours take place in the same city, connected to the same repeating environments doing side missions that I had no idea what purpose they were for.

Not all of DA2 is doom and gloom. This game does have Bioware's quality voice acting and during what little main story there is, there are some very intense and exciting moments that save this game from being a flop. The main story is written well and complex but takes far too long to develop and is drowned out by the annoying constant side quests. The combat can be a bit repetitive at times, but is a lot faster paced and can be quite fun if you are a fan of action RPGs like Diablo. I recommend playing through this title at least once, but wait for it to hit the clearance bins.

"At first, looking at the screenshots and previews, I thought this game looked like a game not worth the playing(the grahpics looked unfinished at the screenshot).But when I started playing, I forgot all those things the second I saw the intro(It was very immpressive).
  You can play nine cvlization, and much of the things is still simalar to Age Of Empires but there are gods to help you or deal with.
  When you expand to a new age, you choose one god and each god has their unique ablity to help you. Like God powers, abllity to summon mythical creatures, powerful upgrades that makes your army strong etc. So you can see why this game is cool because it's like AOE mixed with God things.
  But the bad things is that because this game is following lots of things that used in AOE, it has some bad things that was found at AOE.
  The units are bit small, and the mouse cursor is big, so it's hard to see which unit is which and hard to click the one you want select. But once you get used to it, you'll manage it.

"By now, most people have probably read all the outstanding things about this game. It has great graphics, fun combat, and great boss battles. So I'm going to skip right to the point. Batman Arkham City is a great game! It is just not enough of a sequel to merit 5 stars. Batman Arkham City is basically Arkham Asylum in a sand box setting. It is a great idea but it did not maintain the impact that Arkham Asylum had. The objectives just didn't connect well together for a complete goal. I felt I was wondering from one objective to the next without a real sense of purpose. Everything I did felt like a gimmick to connect me to the next supervillain fight. Also, you start with most of your gadgets from the beginning of the game. Normally this would be a good feature but you do not get many new gadgets throughout the game. There isn't a slow build up of feeling increasingly more powerful. The length is also an issue. I was expecting a lengthy campaign since it was touted in pretty much every review I read but I finished all of the side missions I could find (minus the riddler trophies)and the main story in around the same time as I finished Arkham Asylum. YOU CAN RENT THIS GAME AND COMPLETE ALMOST EVERYTHING IT HAS TO OFFER unless you want to count the New Game+ feature.

"Hydlide just about turned me off forever in the world of RPG for NES, but of course that was a terrible mistake, because Shadowgate is tons better. 3-D type dungeon graphics with a wonderful, easy to operate menu, as well as some truly killer music to go with it which is so much better than that awful music of Hydlide that words fail me. It's a real fun game where you look for keys in all sorts of weird places, read scrolls to obtain spells, get parts for the staff so you can kill the beast at the end of the game. I got a lot of fun finding the sphere so I can take it to the room with the shark infested waters which has the skeleton that has that key. I drop the sphere in the water and I can safely grab the key without being killed by the shark. Another favorite of mine is when you stick a rod by the stairways, lightening strikes it, a skeleton hand reaches out of the ground and you received the wand which you need when you end up in the room with the snake across the broken bridge. I don't want to spoil it all, but for 8-bit NES, the graphics are way cool, and the game is really fun to play.

"I feel as though this review is pretty legit considering I've owned my X12's for almost 5 years.  I have not had one problem with them during that time.  The reason I'm writing this review is because recently I ordered 'No Man's Sky' and I wanted to upgrade my headphones.  Felt I had used them long enough.  I researched headphones for over a week and finally nailed it down to the Playstation Gold Wireless.  They amped those things up to be killer surround and sound quality in general.

I got them last night and hooked them up and sure enough they sounded good.  Although, I was really curious to compare the Gold Wireless Headphones to the X12's.  SO, during a 2 hour play session I switched back and forth in different moments of the game.  Least to say I was blown away.  I was blown away at how GOOD the X12's sound.  The Gold Wireless did not pump out any bass (Even after I tweaked the bass in the settings via the Playstation) and the virtual surround was okay.  To my shock, the X12's pumped bass and actually rivaled the surround sound the Gold Wireless Headphones produced.  NO frickin joke!

Seriously, I immediately took the GOLD wireless phones downstairs, packed them back in the box, put them back in the shipping box, taped it up and requested a refund on Amazon and UPS picked them up the next day.

SO i'm sitting here looking at my X12's and debating whether I purchase a new set of X12's or upgrade to a better Turtle Beach set only because after this  I'm confident Turtle Beach is going to produce the same quality sound in their headphones as the X12's.

SO if your on the fence about these X12's, get them.  It's worth the $40 bucks.  These kicked a $100 headphone in the butt.  ALSO, in case you didn't know, you can easily hook these up to a PS4 using Toslink and a mic wire specifically made for X12 to PS4.

If you want to know how shoot me a reply and I'll explain what I did.  These headphones aren't only for just Xbox.",5.0,B005EQE0YM,These headphones kicked the Sony Gold Wireless butt!  Coming from someone who's had the X12's for 5 years.,Video Games

"All I can say is ""don't bother.""  It seems to me to be the perfect example of form overshadowing function.  The function of a game is to amuse the player.  Oblivion looks pretty good.  Water, trees, the sky, weather, etc are all rendered quite nicely.  The world seems quite large and there are lots of people around who greet you when you're near and keep a schedule which includes sleeping at night etc.  (This can be annoying when you are trying to talk to an NPC who's locked in their bedroom at night though.)

The game lacks a key feature though.  Namely, fun.  RPGs are fun because you get to explore and solve battles all the while gaining power and gear.  A good story is nice too.  Oblivion has you walking around fighting such interesting creatures as ""wolf"" and ""bandit.""  In fact, you're lucky if you happen on much of anything to battle with and most of my time was spent walking from one location to another.  After a few hours of this I looked up the cheats and fast forward to the end of the game and while the monsters get a little more interesting they still lack anything special except maybe pretty ""graffix.""  As a previous reviewer pointed out, the monsters level with you.  So while walking around you will come upon ""ogre"" who are a royal pain to deal with and drop such exciting things as ""ogre teeth.""

I had to restart because after playing for a couple hours I came to the conclusion that the game is horribly ill setup for a magic using character.  Spells can be ""hotkeyed"" to numbers but only a max of eight items or spells can be hotkeyed.  Using a spell requires hitting the appropriate hotkey, targeting the enemy as if you were playing a FPS, and then hitting the ""x"" key.  Oh and you can't switch spells while being hit so using combinations is more or less out of the question.  So I switched to a warrior character and discovered using the cheats that they expect you to do combinations and special attacks using mouse gestures and different clicks.  Am I playing an RPG or am I trying to play Street Fighter II Turbo with a mouse?

I understand if you liked Morrowind maybe this sounds appealing to you.  I do not like the first person view and the third person camera movement and feel is all wrong.  The battle mechanics make this game about as much a FPS as an RPG.  Oblivion goes beyond just being an ""action rpg"" as far as that goes.  NPCs will sometimes ""assist"" in battles and tend to get right in between you and the monsters and absorb your attacks.  This becomes painfully annoying with tougher monsters.

The character models looked okay but they were still just odd looking dolls and it actually made me appreciate the cartoonish WoW graphics more.  This is with the graphics set to Ultra High.

The inventory, spells lists, etc are poorly setup and look unfinished and out of place.  The whole experience made me want to go back and play an RPG on the SNES.

Some people have discussed Oblivion being a replacement for WoW.  Frankly, I really can't see this.  WoW is actually much more polished than Oblivion and while the graphics might not scream for attention like those in Oblivion the attempt at ultra realism in Oblivion fails in my opinion.

In short, lack of originality, leveling monsters, down right stupid battle mechanics, and very slow game play make Oblivion a poor source of entertainment.",1.0,B000BC38LA,"Pretty Face, Hollow and Joyless Center",Video Games

"This is a very good, challenging game to play. the story's very good too. Your suit is damaged by a chemical called X so you have to get your powers back in a new suit which lets you absorb X. But a Powerful chemical of X changes into your shape with your old suit on it. So it shows up sometimes and you have to run away until your stronger.

"I honestly think this is the last hurrah for Star Wars Galaxies, after changing there combat system twice in the last year it just shows that if they want to give this game a more Star Wars feel, make a new game.

I have played Galaxies for almost 2 years now, and yes it never felt like a Star Wars game, I played it more like a fantasy game set in the future, or as many called it Everquest with a Star Wars skin, I mean people were mainly battling with swords and warhammers (power hammers) and the armor they mainly used was called composite, it looked like a cross between a Cylon Centurion and Robocop.

Galaxies has never been a runaway hit, and you would think with the Star Wars name it would be, but like I stated before, it never had a Star Wars feel enough to get Star Wars fans, SOE/LA tried gimmicks like telling players how to become a Jedi,then many of the player base were grinding Jedi, but still didn't get any new customers with their ""BE A JEDI"" campaigns..

The tried a combat revamp several months ago and released the total expansion, which again failed to bring in many new customers, so now the starter kit and the NGE (New Game Enhancments),to make the game more ""Star Warsy"", the combat is a first person shooter type format ala Battlefront, and the took away almost all the old professions from over 30 to 9, based on Star Wars characters, with pics and everything.

But asided from some new quests that in the beginning to make new players feel the game is more like Star Wars, the truth is once those are done, the game is pretty much the same as it always was, just very difficult to reach higher levels, and if you don't have the trials of obi-wan expansion, very difficult, the game still has a lot of bugs, weapons are all pretty much the same now, some professions like trader and entertainer or all but useless, it feels like this new combat system was rushed out the door, just like the older one, because they need new customers to keep the game from dying.

In all honestly instead of changing the game every 6 months, and totally destroying everything many players worked for for months and even years, they should have cut their losses and tried Star Wars Galaxies 2, instead of remaking the old game, which still had many bugs and problems that needed to be fixed, and put in something new which caused even more bugs, and broke things that once was fixed.

I am only staying because of the friends I made their, hard to go once you built up such a community, but if they left I would have been already gone, I would suggest trying a free trial if you can.",2.0,B000BKF2I4,The game is in trouble,Video Games

"I have to admit, for a while I thought there was no better MMORPG than City of Heroes, and my money was on the fact that WoW was probably going to suck.

...Boy was I ever wrong.

WoW has to be the greatest MMORPG ever created. It's not just some cookie-cutter MMORPG with a Warcraft license on it, this game actually rocks! The gameplay is fun and easy to get into, and the interface is just right, so you don't end up getting only half the screen to see through.*Cough*Cough*City of Heroes...

In the game the combat and gameplay is just right to interest people that play in different styles. With the choice of 8 races and 9 classes there is a lot of variety here. That and every race starts in a different spot. (Excluding Gnomes/Dwarves and Orcs/Trolls who start out in the same areas.) The gameplay keeps people interested, and it's perfect for those who don't exactly have the greatest hand-eye coordination in the world. The combat requires strategy and planning to win, it's not often you'll see someone rush headlong into a group of enemies, because if that happened, that person would be on the ground in a matter of seconds.

There's even a variety in servers that you want to be in with 3 different types:

RP: For all those that want to roleplay a personality and not often be bothered by whiny players who ruin the experience.

PVP: This type of server relies strongly on raiding the enemies' areas and defeating the other's side for territory.

Normal: Just a normal server with no strict rules like on RP or a bloodthirsty community like on PVP.

The controls in the game are also well mapped and very smooth, and there is almost no lag where the framerate gets all choppy and bogs down.(I've not seen much except for the dwarven/gnome capital of Ironforge which is a center of commerce and gets lots of players for trade.)

Plus, in this game, it's not required that you group up, even though it makes accomplishing things more efficient. Even a priest doesn't have to group up.(Which, in my opinion, is the least combat-oriented class.) Grouping up is fun, but soloing can be a great experience too.

The audio in the game is particularly good, and character animations are smooth, if you parry a blow, you hear and see it.

The game is also very deep with a wide variety of weapons and trade skills. The classes are organized well and one is never exactly the same as another. They all have some special something that works just for them.

The visuals are clean and will not disappoint players of other Warcraft games, it has the ""cartoonish"" style that players will recognize and remember.

Now to the cons. Well, the cons... the cons.... the cons... there uh, are none, imagine that.

This game takes the genre defined by: ""Killing things just to get some experience."" and takes it to the next level. Buy this game, it's worth the $15 a month, better than SWG, better than CoH, buy it now. Overall, it's an excellent game and the greatest MMORPG on the Market.",5.0,B000067FDW,The Greatest MMORPG on the Market,Video Games
"WOW! Truly amazing graphics. It's not just the fluid movement of the players, it's the minor details. The players adjust their pads after a hit, in a dome they all throw four shadows because of the indoor lighting, the linemen drop the first down marker and run out of the way when the play comes at them, and on and on. Not to mention the depth of play, playing a season, owning a franchise, worrying about the salary cap...it's all there! Or you can just simply play FOOTBALL! The only downside I can really point out is the announcing. It's repetitive and quickly becomes annoying. Not to mention, Lesley Visser is TERRIBLE as the sideline reporter, she sounds like the VISSERTRON 2001, her line-reading is more wooden than Pinnochio. The game however, is simply to beautiful to look at and play to allow the audio to detract from it. Buy this if you want the best football game ever made.",4.0,B00004U5VN,Nearly Flawless,Video Games
"OK, I've given this game a few days of intensive playing and must admit that it says something when you've had such high expectations for a game  and it lives up to it!  Somehow Capcom has managed to take their best game  from the 80's (and probably their first truly great game) and convert it  into a game that will impress game players of today.  And surely the old  platform jumpers and side-scrollers need this sort of rejuvenation.
As to  the game itself: long time Strider fans will find all the old moves here  along with a few new ones--namely dashing, a double jump, a special wall  jump and now an aerial down-up move (not unlike the special moves in other  Capcom side-scrollers, but here limited toan air attack.)  The speed is  obviously upped a few notches and the graphics are far improved, however  this does not fully explain what makes Strider so amazing.
The truly new  innovation here are the 3-D environments you move about in, while still  being true to a 2-D game.  These aren't just pretty 3-D rendered  backgrounds.  This is most noticable if you play the other Strider (Hien),  who will often throw his projectiles off at guards far off in the  background--guards who can also take pot-shots at you.  Add to this that  the environments are often breath taking and amazingly creative and you  have a game that will bring back players over and over again (take for  example the awesome ice-crawling opening to level 3.)
As far as  length...this has been the point I've heard over and over again and dreaded  that we'd have another 20 minute Strider game.  Not true.  If you play  through the whole game (including level 0) it does take about an hour.  Of  course you'll want to improve that and you'll want to master the game so  that you arn't getting killed all the time.  Perhaps this needs a 5  continue limit for the people who are just going to plough through it and  never play it again.  There is definitely an incentive to beat each level  without continuing (and this is not an easy task--even the fairly easy  first level will not be beaten flawlessly without some skill and quick  reflexes.  Also, each level is littered with bonus items, giving good  reason to explore every nook and cranny of the game.  I am amazed over and  over how many places I keep discovering.
Ultimately this game has a lot  of replay value but only if you are the sort of person who likes to master  a game and not just get to the end.  Strider 2 is all about super-cool  environments and a super-cool hero with action sequences that never fail to  deliver.  More so, most everything here can be gotten around without  getting hit at all (for instance--the mine scene can be done without  getting hit once though it will require exploration, experimentation and  creativity.  Thus, for those who still love this sort of game, Strider 2 is  both an excellent return to form and a perfect utilization of the improved  technology/programming.
I should also add that Strider 1 has been  included on the bonus disc, and while this may just be too primitive for  some people, to my sensibilities this remains one of the defining games of  this genre and seems to hold up pretty well to its eleven year  hibernation.
All in all, this is a must purchase for Capcom fans and fans  of arcade style action games.",5.0,B00004SWLY,Strider Hiryu returns in excellent sequel--finally!,Video Games

"The first Rocksmith was a revelation -- an honest-to-goodness practice tool that was also a total blast of fun. It was a completely brilliant idea that was executed very well, but did leave some room for improvement. Well, most of that room has now been filled.

The big one is loading times. That was the original game's major flaw. It seemed as though I spent almost as much time watching the loading icon as I did playing the guitar. The improvement here is very noticeable. Whatever they did to fix the problem worked like a charm.

There are still a few places where the game doesn't seem to register the notes entirely accurately -- there have been times when looping through song sections where it clearly missed an error or mistakenly registered one. However, it does seem a bit more accurate than the original game, and it's not that common. The trick is to understand that it's going to happen and play through it.

One thing that's only relevant to us early adopters of the first game is the inclusion from day one of the bass edition . The original game did not originally come with bass play, which was later offered as a fairly expensive ($30) add-on. Although bass is not mentioned on the front of the case, it is included. When you first run the game, it asks you to select one of three learning tracks: lead guitar, rhythm guitar, or bass. You can also change the track at any time.

The learning guidance is also clearer and easier to use. The game tracks your progress and offers a handful of activities to choose from. One that's new is looping song sections. The section is offered at slow speed and low difficulty level (fewer notes per measure), and is repeated with an increase in one or the other until you're playing every note at full speed. At that point the rest of the song plays out. Looping sections was in the original game, but had to be selected manually and was not as dynamic.

The song list in the new game trends more to classic rock and metal than the original game. I like it; your mileage may vary. The original game's songs can be ""imported"" into the new game for a $10 fee. I find this kind of annoying, but that's how these things work these days.

There is one thing that I wish they would have added to the new version, and that's in-game player profiles. As with the first Rocksmith, it simply uses the currently active Playstation profile to track one's progress. So if there are multiple players in your house, you have to exit the game completely, switch user profiles, and restart to change to another player's in-game profile. This is a major hassle.

Overall, though, there is little to dislike about Rocksmith 2014. If you are an absolute beginner, you ideally should find someone to show you the basics, since the game can't really offer feedback on things like fingering and pick technique. But once you're a little comfortable with the instrument, it'll keep you practicing and improving. Absolutely recommended.",5.0,B00D6PTMB4,A major improvement on an already brilliant game/ practice tool,Video Games

Too Human is a very addictive action RPG.  In fact, you don't even realize it's full potential until at least one full play-through of the game, which is probably why it recieved many negative reviews.

Combat is fun and addictive.  The action elements are just really enjoyable.
The skill trees are very well thought out.
Loot system is very involved.
Co-op is really cool and there is rumor it will be updated to 4 player.
Cool characters and the story is awesome.
Levels are nicely designed.
Replay value is very high!

It is not without its fault as the camera could have used a bit more refinement.  As could the inventory UI.

"I picked up a copy of COD Ghost on Wii U @ Fred Meyer. Have not had enough time to beat the game yet. However, I am close.......The storyline is good. There is an insane amount of action early on in the game. Once you start off as one of Elias' sons. You guys run to your house near by when chaos begins. Big explosions,people frantically driving,ect...Once you get to the house, you are set to play in outter space. When playing in outter space, it is as if you can almost feel being weightless out there, on the controller (gamepad). From there, you play various parts & times in the storyline. Ghost covers pretty much any war experience you could think of. The layout and gameplay of Ghost is great! Fluently, smoothly plays. Many people have recommended playing w/ the Wii U Pro Controller. I personally enjoy using the gamepad controller. If your used to playing COD on Xbox 360 (like me) or on PS3. It does take a few minutes to get used to playing it w/ the gamepad controller. But you get the hang of it with in a few minutes. You can even use the last gen Wii controllers for playing if you like? The graphics on Wii U's Ghost is awesome! Looks really crisp,vibrant, and detailed. I have not seen or played it yet on other consoles. But I have Modern Warfare 2 on Xbox 360. And this game looks better than that. It probably looks as good, or slightly better than the Xbox 360 version. As many are saying the Wii U version was just ported from Xbox's Ghost, by the developers. The campaign is great,multiplayer is great in my opinion, and you can even customize characters! There is no zombie mode in this game. However there is a new mode called Extinction. Extinction is similar to zombie mode. In a sense that you go through waves/rounds & try to survive. But in Extinction, you are going up against aliens. On multiplayer you can even play one player. And add bots (A.I.) to your squad & as opposition. The maps are fun to play.....some more expansive than others. Some people are saying Wii U's version lacks a few maps,ect..But the number of maps is  available is good to me! Also, people & critics online have mentioned the frame rate on Wii U is slightly lower than PS4 & Xbox One's  60FPS. Saying Wii U's is about 50-58FPS. In my opinion....you'll only see a difference if you have eagle eyes, haha....Trust me, this  Wii U Ghost game moves fast & smoothly overall! Yes the Wii U version lacks a few maps,less online players (though still a lot of  people),ect...But it isn't lacking anything that makes or breaks the game! It has almost everything every other console offers. And for  a port of another consoles it is a great port! Hopefully next COD is developed for Wii U too instead of just ported. But as a Wii U  owner, I am very happy to have Ghost in it's game library! I recommend this game to anybody that is thinking about getting it.  Anybody that loves FPS games.

"A MUST PLAY for anyone with a PS2 looking for a different type of game, into being scared without gore. It's definitely a love/hate relationship for me! I'd actually bought this game back around 1999 or 2000 when I got my first PS2. I started playing and at first, while it was so scary it gave me goosebumps, it was also exciting to keep discovering items and progressing. I was able to continue for a while. It's not gory in anyway-you're essentially investigating a case in a haunted mansion equipped only with a special camera to see/battle/capture spirits or take photos of clues the naked eye can't fully detect-something might just look a little ""odd"" so you snap a photo-sometimes it's a clue-like a hidden doorway or puzzle piece, sometimes it's nothing and you've wasted precious film. As you explore, the ""spirit sensor"" light might start to glow, meaning there's a spirit nearby. With the rumble pack throbbing to your increased heartbeat, you might often get attacked from behind or in some cases, as you're frantically looking around through the view finder (the only way to see the spirits), you're being attacked near your feet. Anyway, I only got a little way into the game and was too scared to continue, traded it in. A few years later, I was totally in the mood for a different kind of game, THIS kind of game. Bought it, started playing it and almost got to the same place and quit once again, gave the game away to a friend. Finally, about 6 months ago, I once again felt like playing it, bought it and yes, shortly after reaching the same place (completely prepared for everything up to that point), I again got too frightened to keep playing. A friend of mine bought the release after this, which I also played, not nearly as scary for some reason.

Units are mostly military in nature, and designed for offensive or defensive purposes, depending on what sort of victory you're going for. Buildings are used to enhance your city and push it in one of several directions, making it a production or cultural powerhouse that also reaps gold or scientific knowledge to advance your technology.

Which brings us to the Tech Tree, obviously important for a technological victory, but vitally important for the others as well. Initially your starting civ will have the ability to learn only four technologies - Alphabet, Bronze Working, Horseback Riding, or Pottery. An advisor instructs you as to the benefits and uses of each technology, letting you know if it's primarily for cultural, scientific or military use. Learning a tech unlocks further techs, taking you from archers and warriors to modern infantry, tanks, battle ships and bombers. The handy Tech Tree - showing all techs and what is needed to unlock them - is available to view at any time, so you can plot what to research on your road to glory. Being the first to research a tech before other civs usually offers a bonus, such as a free unit or city enhancement.

The game then becomes a balancing act. Focus too much on one area, such as military production at the expense of culture, and watch as your cities begin to ""flip"" to civs with higher culture. Focus too much on infastructure without building defense and your neighbors will roll over you. In essence, this forces you to really think about what your next move should be and deepens the game play. Which, of course, leads to a ""just one more turn"" approach that has you playing long after you originally planned on quitting. And that's just Single Player mode. Toss in playing against real people over the 'net or a LAN hook-up and, well, kiss your free time goodbye...

All in all, if you enjoy strategy games, you should really enjoy this outing. Kudos to the folks that put this together for dipping their toe into the console market.

"I was excited about this game when I first hear about it and saw trailers, but in actually playing this, I was a little let down.
To be honest, I am not sure why though.

I was not expecting HD graphics on a Vita version (although I do not believe the PS3/4 versions have any better).
You do not buy these type of games for stunning visuals, but to have yourself challenged and feel rewarded for the time you put into it.

This is not a typical RPG or strategy game, but more of a hybrid.
Combat can be grueling and one mistake on your part can lead to decimation - quickly.
Its rather unforgiving in that realm.

The main concept is chaining attacks and part members together to defeat the almost always sea of monsters that outnumber your at least 3 to 1 (in a good situation).
You can also chain them to defend on another and this is just as essential to the part survival.
You do not get to save until the dungeon/battle is over, but it does save ""checkpoints"" during the battle.
So if you make a mistake, you have start over from a checkpoint, which can be grueling.
It almost forces you to be perfect, which can be OK at times, but just seems punishing in this game.

This is definitely not a game for everyone or for those with little patience.

The RPG system is limited in the amount of upgrades you can give your characters in terms of skills.
Gear has to be found mainly by running the dungeons over and over.

The ""magic"" system costs a very valuable and rare resource that is acquired every time you loot a chest or sell and item, however all spells cast are drained from the same universal pool and cannot be regenerated by ""resting"" or finding an Inn.
This makes you value it much more and be very wise with the use of it.

The challenge factor is definitely present in this game.
This game is definitely a unique idea and was put into practice very well.
The link system seems so simple at first, but can easily become so very complex and confusing.

Overall, for the price this game currently goes for, I would definitely say to a hardcore gamer to give this a shot to experience a very unique style RPG

As for the game, nothing spectacular but fans of the series will like it. It has a lot of the voice actors from the series and you get the feel that you are actually in one of the episodes. Gameplay is sneaky and you rely more on objects to use as weapons than you do actual weapons. You don't even start with a gun. The puzzles are easy and the game is not very long.

"I'm an adventure gaming fan, so I was thrilled to hear about Syberia as a worthy entry in the genre, with frequent comparisons to The Longest Journey. I bought it ASAP, not expecting a clone of TLJ by any means, just hoping for a good adventure game.
Well, I have yet to finish Syberia and it's been 9 months. The game is breathtakingly beautiful to look at, and obviously designed with care.
But as lovely as the game is to look at, the story is kind of plodding, the voice acting is (frankly) terrible, and the game just has no personality. The player is given little chance to explore environments or make choices -- you simply have to point and click your way through every (often very derivative) puzzle to get to the next point.
One of the things I loved about ""Longest Journey,"" as well as ""Sanitarium,"" ""Grim Fandango"" ""Myst 3"" and the ""Monkey Island Series,"" was the sense that we got the chance to contribute to the story or character's choices and personality. Characters like April and Guybrush really sparkle simply because the game doesn't just want to get you from A to Z, but to help you explore a world and feel part of it. So there are those little extras, like clicking on an object or a character just to enjoy the protagonist's responses to it (""I'm not picking that up!"") and to learn about the character. There's nothing like this in Syberia.
I wish I'd liked it more, and do hope to finish the game someday (I got about 2/3 through before finally giving up in boredom). But it's ironic that the story is about automatons -- the character of Kate is almost as flat and uninteresting as an automaton herself.

"Halo 3 - Circa 2007

GOOD:
- Four-player online (or offline) co-op Gameplay allows two; three, or four players play through the game from start to end. A co-op player can come into the game at any time and leave at any time (note only one of you will play as the Master Chief, while another will play as the Arbiter, and the other two players will be Elites that work with humans)
- Great looking graphics and animation, that look even better then Halo 2, F.E.A.R. and just as good as Bioshock, while these graphics might not look as good as Gears of War do to some people these graphics still are some of the best seen to date.
- Intense multiplayer action online through Xbox Live with matches as small as one on one and as big as 16 players (and offline with out using Xbox Live using either spilt screen, or system link). Halo 3 is set up similar to Halo 2 in the sense that you're given a rank when you play multiplayer (this rank can go up or down at any time) this rank is representative of your skill and your matched with others of your skill type, that way new unskilled players and hardcore veterans will not often play against one another, unless they make a special match themselves that ignores rank.

BAD:
- Confusing plot to new players of this franchise - Playing Pervious games and read the Halo Novels will fill you in on the details, if you are incline to learn them.
- No Clan Support (like in Halo 2) - This might get fixed in a future patch
- Game is considered short to some (Campaign Story Mode).

IF IT FITS YOUR TASTE:
- A Sci-Fi First Person Shooter with quick pacing and vehicle combat.
- Co-op and online versus/team games is the big draw here.
- NEW MODE: Forge is a mode that lets you edit all the maps in Halo 3, while you cannot rebuild the maps themselves you can in this mode, add and take away any and all of the objects from vehicles and guns to spawning points and flag zones. This is all done in real time and you can invite friends to this mode while your customizing the map(s), they can play a multiplayer game while your doing this (instead of just waiting for you) and if you want you can forgo editing the map and join the game at hand as either a player or the map editor (who looks like 343 Guilty Spark), while playing as the map editor you can still add and take away any and all objects from vehicles and guns to spawning points and flag zones any time you want.
- NEW MODE: Theater Mode is a video editor that lets you record and play back any and all matches from Campaign, Multiplayer, and Forge modes from the point of view of any player either in first person or third person (even in a orbit-cam where the camera circles around the player) all in real time (you can also pause this at any time as well as fast forward and rewind), even use your camera to fly around the match and see the match from any angle you want, Don't forget you must save your videos before you turn off the game or you will lose said videos. Also you can take a picture at any time and save it to your Xbox 360 then download your picture at Bungie.net

GAME ITS MOST ASSOCATED TOO:
- Halo 2 (Xbox)
- Halo (Xbox)
- Resistance: Fall of Man (PS3)
- Bioshock (360)
- Gears of War (360)

ADDITIONAL NOTES:
- There are bonus items scattered through the Campaign Story Mode called Skulls getting these ""Skulls"" will make the game harder (by doing things like turning off radar for the rest of the Campaign Mode your playing it) but will also greatly increase your meta game score for the Campaign Mode.
- There are two different limited collectors editions of this game. One is called the limited edition, which comes in a metal tin and has a bonus disc (with behind the scene videos and such) and also comes with an art book. While the other limited edition (called Legendary edition) you will find an art book a mini poster two bonus DVDs (with behind the scene videos and such as well as a collection of all the cut scenes form Halo and Halo 2 and themes you can download to your 360) And the it comes with a plastic Master Chief Helmet to keep your DVDs in (Helmet as big a volley ball).
- At Bungie.net you can sign up and pay a small fee to upgrade your Halo 3 account (default is free) to hold more space on their serves for your videos/pictures/clips that you made.",5.0,B000K8YAKI,Return of the King,Video Games

"There is just so much Mario these days for Nintendo's vast amount of video games, it can almost make your head spin. For the past several months, he has appeared in several great games for Nintendo's Gamecube system. First, he and his friends and enemies wowed us with the thrill of baseball in Mario Superstar Baseball. Next, he tried it again to the beat of Dance Dance Revolution with his own wave of the arcade clasic. Last month, he also scored big with the return of the board game classic in Mario party 7. Now, the turn of the single chant of Soccer strikes, and it happens to be a goal.

Super Mario Strikers for Nintendo's Gamecube is a rock'em, sock'em  sports game, where Mario and friends tackle on the world of soccer. The game is themed with soccer through Nintendo's uniqueness without any loss. In the game, you can choose your captain from Mario or Luigi, to characters like Donkey Kong and Yoshi. The game also features methods of tricking your opponents from scoring a goal with weapons like the koopa shells, electric fences, and banana peels, similar to Mario Power Tennis. The control is a bit complex at first, but it is very easy to pick up with a little practice, and the graphics are really superb for anybody who loves to score a goal. The game also includes some terrific mini-games to help you score and control your characters.

All in all, Super Mario Strikers is a well-recognized soccer game for anybody who owns the Nintendo Gamecube. This is a great purchase for any die hard sports fanatic, or for all of us who have been longtime fans of Mario and company. Considering there haven't really been at all many soccer games for the Nintendo Gamecube, this one scores big.

"I bought the European/UK EA Value Games edition in the orange case from seller NAYKED APPAREL.  The CD key/ serial key was hard to read (small print, and the V looked like a U), but after I got the code right, it installed fine on my PC running Windows XP SP3.

I downloaded the free Bring Down the Sky (BDTS) downloadable content (DLC), but there was no way to register Mass Effect on Bioware's website or EA's website (and you had to register Mass Effect in order to get the BDTS serial key; but the game is old now, so they no longer accept registration for it).  So, you have to email EA support.  They responded to my request for a BDTS serial key within 2 hours.  I understand that the BDTS serial key is generic, so the same key could be used by many people; however, key activation also depends on EA servers.  If you have a key and it doesn't seem to work, keep trying for a few days.

I also bought Pinnacle Station DLC from the Origin Store for 5 bucks, and it came with the 1.02 patch for Mass Effect.  Pinnacle Station is like a shooting gallery / hologram deck, where you pit your fighting skills against hologram characters.  It's not a true mission like the other missions.

The value edition comes with a second disk. The extra disk is for other European languages; look in the ""data"" folder, and you will find several large .rar files for German, French, and Italian. Unless you select one of those languages during install, you will not be prompted to use the second disk. And the ""eurodocs"" folder contains game manuals for 12 languages, including English.

If you are looking for the English manual, go to the second disk; you will find it in the ""eurodocs"" folder in the sub-folder named ""English"".

So, what about the game itself?  You can read many other reviews for that!  I will say this: It plays like a movie, which is very cool.  Just the right amount of RPG, just the right amount of action, and very good story/plot and character development.  Excellent graphics, voice acting, and cut scenes.

"Yeah, it's terribly cheesy and the dialogue is corny as hell.  Yeah, it's totally gritty grindhouse.  Yeah, the graphics suck.

But it's SUPPOSED TO BE THAT WAY!

They really went for a certain feel with the early 2000 graphics and super cheesy profane violence, but it's great!  Lovely way to spend an evening laughing with friends and popping zombies.

Plus you gotta love a game that rewards you with ""Goregasms"" symbolized by a cheesy Waving American flag when you get onto a role.

It's a fast play -- you'll be through it in a few hours.  But the replay is good and it's something for when you want to burn steam and not have to do much (anything) in the way of strategy.

It's fun...love it for what it is.

"I first found and started playing Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri nearly 20 years ago. Despite owning hundreds of games since, I still found myself going back to it at least once a month to try to beat it in some way more fantastic than the last. It's the only game I've played so consistently for so long, and probably will remain as much.

This game is excellent. It's so much more involved and detailed than Alpha Centauri, but has so much familiar in it that it felt like home from the very first play attempt. It's a lot harder! I can beat it in the easiest difficulty so far with 1-2 computer opponents, but I've only had it a week and not been able to play each day. I'm sure with practice I'll be dominating some rival factions in no time ;)

For those not familiar with Alpha Centauri or the Sid Meier's/Civilization games.. this is basically a game where you start off with a base and have to build it up with troops, people, research technologies, and expand your faction with more bases. All the while you're navigating the dangerous terrain of an alien world with sometimes hostile wildlife and the even more dangerous waters of diplomatic communication with other factions. Some will be your friends, some will try to destroy you. Your actions and behaviors will determine how they view you, and whether they like or hate you. Your actions will even determine whether the native lifeforms will like you or hate you. Everything is inter-connected, it's great. You have multiple ways to beat the game.. battle domination, technological supremacy, and quite a few more. These games can last for hours, many hours, but of course have an option to save so you can resume later.",5.0,B0145Q5PC2,"As a long time Alpha Centauri fan, this feels like home",Video Games

"I'm a big fan of Medal of Honour: Allied Assault and its predecessor Medal of Honour  (for the PS). Both games were very well done and I really enjoyed storming Omaha Beach, driving the King Tiger Tank, sabotaging the deadly u-boat and destroying the V2 Rocket Plant. Both were great games. So when I saw Medal of Honour: Spearhead, I thought that it would be just as good. Well, I half to say I was a little disappointed. The game has by far the best opening. Its starts out with you as Sgt. Jack Barnes; paratrooper with the 101st. You and a squad are awaiting to be dropped behind enemy lines on D-Day. As you slowly drift down, enemy flak explodes around you, many of your planes are shot down, triple A tracers fly up from the ground,  fellow paratroopers are all around you, and if you watch carefully you can even see one free falling with-out a parachute. When you land, you crash through the roof of a  barn full of German soldiers.  Fallowing this, you'll be whisked away on 9 levels from Normandy to Berlin, where you'll sabotage German artillery, bridges, and you even get to drive a Soviet T34 tank. Here are some of the new tweaks Spearhead adds to the game: you can now lean side to side (helps to peak around corners), you can control the 7.62 mm machine gun on the Soviet tank, you can operate all sorts of artillery, there are a new weapons, there's 12 new multiplayer maps and a new multiplayer ""tug of war"" and  trees now snap into as you bound away at them with the heavy machine guns. What I didn't like about the game is that the expansion was way to short and  made the German soldiers dumber and easier to kill. In Allied Assault, it would take about three rifle shots (in the torso) to take down an opposing soldier. In most of Spearhead, its only a one shot kill. Also the Germans tend to stand around a lot, unaware of your presence even if your raging a battle around them. There are also a number of graphical and sound glitches that kind-of take away from the game. For in stance, when you shoot the Lee Enfield and the Gewehr 43 rifles, there is no sound. You'll here the bullet hit what ever it is you shoot at, but there is no ""bang"" as you push the fire button. I also noticed this problem with the Soviet tank cannon and some of the artillery. I don't know if this is a bug in the game or what, but it didn't happen in MOH:AA.  Graphically, Spearhead is the same as Allied Assault, and the sounds are just as good. What I really liked were the Poems that were read after the completion of each mission. Over all Spearhead offers a fun after noon of fighting, but isn't worth $30. I'm just glade I found the game on a $10 sales rack, other wise I would have felt a little ripped.",3.0,B00006F7RJ,a little disappointed.....,Video Games

"A little back story:
I purchased a PS3 back in 2011, and it still works as perfectly as the day it was opened.  My PS3 got me through college, and will soon be given to my little brother to get him through college.  So I'm not a stranger to Playstation.  When I graduated I moved in with three housemates who are all PC gamers.  I spent ~$3,000 building a desktop and it. is. amazing.  Made Skyrim on PS3 look like an N64 game.  I was fairly reserved when buying the PS4 because I was so used to top-notch graphics and no loading screens.

The PS4 graphics are just as mind-blowing.  The rendering of shadows, lighting and water in Destiny are so incredible, really, hats off to those responsible for it.

PS4 Review:
Graphics are mindblowingly good
Interface seems much easier to use than the PS3 was
Sleek design.  Slightly annoyed at how small the power button is, and I think it might be touch instead of an actual button.

PS4 Controller:
Nice design, personally I actually liked the PS3 controllers better though.
Some people had been complaining about the joysticks, but I'm at ~40 hours of gameplay and they're still perfect.
Doesn't seem to hold a charge nearly as long as the PS3 controllers, but I have my PS4 set up on my computer desk ~3feet from me so I just keep it plugged in.  I don't have a solid number for you, but if I had to guess I'd say it would only last about 5 or so hours.
The ""headset"" they give you is an uncomfortable earpiece with a mic attached, like you used to see come with phones.  I'm going to try to get my work bluetooth to connect because that's kinda irritating and the earbud hurts and won't stay in my ear.

Destiny Review:
Graphics: 10/10, amazing
Gameplay: 10/10, amazing
Storyline: lolwut
The story is never clear, and they never really explain.  They get around this by characters saying things such as ""I don't have time to explain"" or ""you know the legend yes?"" and Dinklebot will reply ""of course"" before you can even say ""uhh no? Care to tell me what's happening?""  They also tell you to go online to read cards you unlock which explain the story.
Leveling up to 20 was fun and pretty quick, I really enjoyed the missions even if I didn't really know why I was doing stuff.
Strike missions require PSPlus but are definitely worth it, they require 3 people to play and give a lot of experience and are pretty tough.
Crucible (multiplayer pvp) is Halo-like, except that you keep all your guns, armor and moves from singleplayer which is fun and adds a lot of diversity.  It also means the higher level people dominate, but if you're good you can hang, and you get good rewards.  Personally I avoided it until I was level 20 and now I'm doing okay.
Patrol: a mode where you basically have free reign to wander the different locations (Russia, Moon, Venus, Mars), taking mini missions as you see fit and killing enemies for experience.  This is wonderful for leveling up and for taking in the sights!
Leveling past 20 is weird, because it requires leveling up your armor instead of XP bar.  I won't bother getting into details on that though, basically you just need to play a LOT of matches and get better armor to advance.  I'm currently level 23 and still having fun.
Issues:
Story line was over pretty quickly, and I didn't really know what was happening.  For a company capable of such a great story as the Halo series, this was disappointing.
Getting new weapons and armor - this one is the biggest issue people seem to have.
You get something called an ""engram"" which you take to someone to decode.  It has a % chance of giving you an item which is common, uncommon, rare, or legendary.  This is how you get almost all of your items and weapons, which means it's entirely up to chance.  People have played a strike mission, spent a good half hour killing a difficult boss and gotten a Legendary Engram, only to have it pop out a Rare item which is useless to them at that point in the game.  Even the Legendary Engrams only have an okay-ish chance of giving you a legendary item.  Leveling in this manner is a real pain.  For example, I've spent longer going from 20 to 23 than I did going from 1 to 20.

Overall, from a long-time PS3 fan converted to a PC gamer, this bundle was completely worth it.  I am pretty sure I spent ~24 hours a week playing League of Legends on average before purchasing this bundle.  Since then, I haven't signed onto League once, I've been too eager to play Destiny with some of my college friends.

As a side note - Some may ask why I didn't just get Destiny on PS3.  My college roommates, whom I never get to see, both have a PS4 and played Destiny on it.  I wanted to join them, so I basically spent an additional $400 just to get the proper system to play with them.

"I finally have both current gen systems and can fairly compare them.
To be a hundred percent honest, the major factor in me wanting a PS4 was to play 'Infamous: Second Son'. And let me tell you, it was totally worth it! The game is a blast! If you liked the other two, and you'll like this one too, but that, my friends, is for a separate review.
First, I will say that I didn't buy thispackage from Amazon. I bought it from a certain specialty store that was running a trade in deal towards the purchase of a PS4. It was either this or the 'Last of Us' bundle, and since I had already played through it on the PS3, I chose this one.
'Destiny' the game itself is what it is. If you're like me and putzed around with it upon first release, there isn't a whole lot more to it. It's mostly cosmetic changes.
The console itself, as far as the paint job, is okay. I'm not sure what all the high praise is about. It seems like a cheap silk screen job on a regular arctic white shell. I personally prefer the original black. I really wish I had gotten myself one of those nice MGS models, but whatever.
The updates are nice. The new model runs much more quietly. The physical buttons on the front are nice. The new hard-drive try is nice too. A bit easier to swap out than before. I put in a 2TB drive before I even powered it on for the first time after realizing from owning the Xbone how paltry 500GB is for the current gaming generation. Most games install something like 15-30GB of data on your drive. Wait till something like a new Elder Scrolls game comes out and they really figure out how to harness the power of these systems. A word of warning though: If you are one of the people who are waiting for the 1TB version to be released, you are much better off getting a 500GB system and slapping your own drive in. From what I understand, the terabyte version will be about $100 more. Even if it's only $50 more, you're better off buying a 2TB drive from good 'ol Amazon for $80-90 and slapping it in. Then you have a 500GB drive to do what you will with and double the memory in your system.
AAnyway, I'm not going to get into the whole debate over which system is better. You can't convince a fanboy of either side that the competition is better. For me, the major catalyst to me buying the Xbone first is the exclusives. The Xbone's just appealed to ME more. That's not true for everyone, I know, but it was for me. I did need 'Infamous: Second Son' though. :-D
Well, I hope this rant helped you out in some way. It's a good system, a mediocre game and a cool paint job for a younger gamer. The updates to the console itself do warrant a purchase over the standard system.",5.0,B012UGC9F0,My Opinion...,Video Games

"If you look at the review distribution, there are a lot of 5-star reviews and 1-star reviews, with not so much in the middle. I found this to be, however, a very mediocre game that is certainly not worthy of 5-stars but not deserving of a 1-star rating either. I think what you have here are die hard fans of the series either very disappointed (leading to the 1-star reviews) or vigorously defending the RE series (leading to the 5-star reviews).

I've read 50 plus reviews on here and waited until I finished the game before writing this review. I can tell you for a certainty that there are a lot of reviews on here that didn't play enough of the game to justify their review. For example, many people said in their review how you need to beat all 3 campaigns to unlock the Agent Hunt extra. Wrong. You only need to beat one campaign and the Agent Hunt option will unlock.

I beat both the Leon and Chris campaign and played about half of the Jake campaign before I got bored with the game and decided I'm done with it. And unlike RE4 and RE5 which I still have, I'm going to be selling back RE6 which at the time of this writing is already about $20 below the original release price. That's a pretty fast drop 3 weeks after release for an RE game! So clearly many people were disappointed with the game.

I liked the Leon campaign best which was surprising a little as I expected I would like the more action-oriented Chris campaign. But after the 1st chapter of the Leon campaign it was basically all action. What I liked better about the Leon campaign though was that it didn't seem to drag on like the Chris campaign did. The Chris campaign had way too much ""chasing Ada"" in it and felt very repetitive during Chapters 4 and 5.

Everyone has mentioned the overuse of the QTE's and I'm no exception. Hated it! Way too many. However, there were a few new things I did like. Like the new directional feature (the golden arrow accessed via the ""L-2"" button) to show the direction you need to travel, very good implementation for this game. Another cool implementation is being able to shoot while lying on your back - this came in handy several times during battle. However, like many others I too have found the new inventory control feature confusing, though after a few hours of playtime I did finally figure out how it works. I still like the old system better of carrying items in a suitcase, and RE4 did it best I think in that you could upgrade your suitcase to carry more items as the game progressed. However, I see what Capcom was trying to do here by allowing you to access all of your inventory during gameplay rather than having to wait until you finish gameplay and then have access to it. But the implementation of it is awkward and not user-friendly. The key I think is to leave a couple of slots available so that when a battle ensues you can pick-up specialty items like grenade launcher ammo for example, and not have to fumble with your inventory and delete things you don't need. So I think Capcom did make some improvements to this game over the previous RE games, though some of them (like the inventory system) were not well-implemented.

I think what I missed the most were the notes and journals that you could read and collect from RE4 or RE5 - to me this always added great value to the story. Now you are looking for and shooting blue stars that unlock parts of the story. But I think it makes much more sense to find these items and read them during the flow of the game. You should be uncovering these story aspects at the point in the story that it makes sense to learn about them, not an hour or hours later after you stop playing and go back to read what you found. But I know many people don't care about the storyline and just play for the action, which is probably why Capcom made this change. But for me, I replayed RE4 and RE5 just to gain the journals and notes so I could understand more parts of the story, but with RE6 I didn't even bother.

I also don't like the skill system - this is borrowed from several other action games where you can enhance skills and abilities of your character or the game play. I much prefer the old system of collecting money and upgrading my weapons with the money.

When I heard that there would be three campaigns with intertwined stories I thought it was going to be a really well-developed storyline, but what we got was boring, repetitive, and discombobulated. RE4 and RE5 I played on each of those for about one month. Replaying because I was interested in doing so. I played this game for 2 weekends and finished nearly all of it and have no desire to replay any of it.

". . . Is to be the world's most bad-ace super-spy this side of Metal Gear. And hey, to be honest, Sam Fisher can even give old Snake a run for his money, both as a character and in terms of the title's gameplay, and that's not easy to do.
First off, Splinter Cell takes place in the Tom Clancy near future (much nearer now than it was when the game was released) of the fall of 2004. The Georgian president, after reaching power through a bloodless coup, was being investigated by the US. Trouble is, the agent, or agents, doing the snooping have gone missing. Now, as a member of Third Echelon, Sam Fisher must find them, and what they discovered that got them in trouble. And, as is the case with Tom Clancy's universes, there's a whole lot more going on than meets the eye. As Sam, you have to find out what. Sam's getting gray around the temples, but he's more than capable of holding his own, and getting Michael Ironsides for his voice was inspired.
The name of the game here is stealth. And this game won't hold your hand as much as Metal Gear Solid, making it that much more challenging. I could go on and on about the fabulous graphics; the lighting, the animation, the butter-smooth control, and the extraordinary AI. However, I won't. They are all top notch, the AI especially. Sound and sight are what alerts them to your presence, which means light and noise are your enemies. You have to creep around slowly and softly, stick to the shadows, or create your own. Take enemies out one at a time, or pass them by in the darkness like a ghost.
That's really the best thing about this game: total and complete immersion. The world, lives, breathes, and thinks, and you have to stay one step ahead of it. Splinter Cell encourages you, FORCES you, to think like a highly trained covert operative. You must become Sam Fisher, because if you don't, you'll die, a lot. Actually, you'll probably die a lot anyway, but in this game, that's not a problem. In some parts, this thing is unrelenting. Tom Clancy's one-hit-one-kill rules apply here, for both you AND your enemies. However, patience will keep you alive, along with caution, and, most importantly, you have to think like a spy.
And that is what makes this game so great. Sure, there are a couple isolated times when you think that enemies should see you and they don't. Sure there are some times when a little more help from your espionage cohorts would be nice. However, this game is rooted in realism, and it'll stay with you. For example, you know you've been playing the game too much when you walk into your bedroom when the light is off and immediately notice which corner would be best to hide in. Seriously, this game makes you think like a spy that much, and, if you have the patience and skill, it is extrememly freakin' fun.
There's not really much of a downside to this game. Unfortunately, don't expect the amount of action found in titles like Halo, or even Metal Gear Solid. This is about patience, information gathering, and doing it all without leaving a trace. However, if you dig this sort of game, you are doing yourself a disservice by not getting it and enjoying it.",5.0,B00006JZQZ,"Your Mission, Should You Choose To Accept It. . .",Video Games

"I'll tell you now i've never been a fan of the Need for Speed series. Not that I was against it or anything, I remember playing the first one when it was brand new and it was ok, but I never really got involved in it, and over the years I got into the GTA games and figured whats the point of just racing when GTA offers more and having played breifly the previous Undercover and not being impressed, Well, I was given this game and low and behold... I was hooked in minutes!

Its a simple transition from GTA 5/Online racing to this game. The controls are very much the same and both games seems identical enough to be something where if you enjoy one, you can enjoy the other too. It features a city map that compared to GTA is rather small, but it works for this game and everything is easy to get used to and give you an understanding of how the game works and what you're meant to do.

It features a vast amount of cars, ranging from average everyday ones to super cars to really blow the doors off racers. Bonus points for featuring my favorite, the Lamborghini Countach. Mods and upgrades are easy enough to obtain, but not too easy, they will take practice, and the races do give you a good feel of speed involved. You can take it to the street and work your way through becoming the #1 racer in a top 10 list offline, or join online and compete in various other races against other people. Which surprisingly online still works and has not been shut down so far like many other games that over a year old.

My only gripes with the game is the annoying cops. Sometimes they just come out of nowhere going faster than they should, but it only bothered me in new cars that had not had their ram chasis upgraded yet, so anything that touched me would cause me to crash out, until you make the car stronger.

There are things you can do in the game, but it's mostly just adding up race points to unlock the next pro driver on the top 10 list, or being victorious in races for upgrades. But the thing I like best is that most cars are unlockable from the start. You just need to find them on the map and then they are yours to use whenever you like... none of the grinding races for money to try and afford the good cars.

There is plenty of extra DLC too, but none of it is free, and tho I enjoyed this game a lot, I really don't feel the need to spend the price they ask to unlock an airport area, or another amount of $ to unlock movie cars etc... and the overall price to unlock everything does not seem worth it to me. Maybe if it was 99cents per car you want, I'd consider it, but I guess to each their own when it comes to that stuff.

"Lets get a few things out of the way first... The people complaining about the lack of a story in this game are really selling themselves (and the game)short. Dead Island follows the same method that every other zombie game follows: 1. Theres a virus 2. people are zombies 3. somehow your immune 4. grab a gun (or rusty pipe) 5. Start smashing faces 6. Repeat. THATS IT! If your okay with that methodology and approach this as an engrossing rpg experience, your going to make it through with your sanity.

Ive heard a lot of people make comparisons of dead island to games like borderlands and oblivion. If your expecting borderlands your going to be sorely disappointed because DI does not even touch its level of depth or sense of adventure. If your expecting Oblivion your going to get something similar in experience but something not quite as deep. DI (like Oblivion imo) is very slow paced. Dont expect to be grabbing machine guns and showering down hellfire upon troves of the undead because you won't even get your grimy hands on a gun until 1/4 of the way through the main story. 90% of the game you will spend in close combat situations bashing in zombies faces with upgraded blunt instruments and knives. Thats where the actual 'charm' of this game lies, its a very well put together first person melee adventure. You have to expect to spend a lot of time searching for parts to assemble weapons and mastering the jump-kick maneuver to save yourself from sticky situations which there will be a lot of.

Combat is completely fun once you learn how to start stringing together combos for big XP gains and once you master the manual swing controls. The actual combat animations are exactly the same throughout the entire game and do get a little boring after you have sliced off a zombies head for the 900th time. Enemies are a little monotonous as well with there only being 4 or 5 different 'types' of monsters that you will fight over and over again. There are human enemies as well whom are better dealt with using the firearms found later in the game but even they don't offer a lot of extra color to an otherwise black and white zombie filled island.

(This is sounding more negative than I actually intend for it to, I really really do like this game but I want to point out its obvious flaws for the curious)

The landscapes are gorgeous and very lifelike although you will encounter a lot of graphical glitches that leave you scratching your head, my favorite being picking up a box or propane tank and walking to a door will allow you to drop it inside the closed door. Things like that should have been caught by the developers but you can nitpick any game and find annoying 'oopsies' that feel like lazy beta testing. The maps feel large and the areas are pretty well laid out. There are usually plenty of area to explore and lots of hidden items and survivors to find who will give you additional tasks to complete for them (except the sewers... screw the damn sewers!)

Questing is about the same for any RPG style game (go find me three of these, move that thing, shoot that, give me a hug, pet my dog, find my insulin, flush this fetus, kick that, etc.) youve played all these missions before in different games and if you found them fun in those games you will enjoy them here. There is a fair amount of grinding required in the later levels and even though monsters are leveled at the same time as you, you will often find yourself overwhelmed by their numbers if you venture to far out without strong weapons or skills to back you up. Play conservatively and pick up everything to use for parts or sell to the drunks scattered around the map.

The characters are well.. ok, again think zombie movie characters. There like that. Stereotypical, pretty dull and full of annoying catch phrases that will inevitably be said a million+ times. Not a lot of time was spent worrying about what would be (or COULD be) done with the characters or NPC's. It just wasn't a priority for the developers and it shows, but again, who the hell cares? Grab a baseball bat with nails in it and make it rain brains and eyeballs, why else would you play a game like this? Seriously?

Multiplayer is completely pointless unless you know the person you are playing with. The game has a very cool feature that lets you instantly drop in and out of other peoples games and work on quests together, trade items, level up etc. Which is cool in theory, except people seem to jump into your game at inopportune times or you jump into theres and find out they are a much higher level than you and someone ends up not having fun. Stick with people you know because that aspect is a lot of fun.

Ok wrapping this up, The game is a lot of fun even though it is full of annoying and sometimes stupid issues. My only REAL complaint with the game is that there are no boss battles. New monsters are introduced with cutscenes and such but then you kill the one monster and three minutes later find another one to kill. I won't ruin anything, but don't expect much of a climax either. Boss battles would have made this game amazing and why they were left out is nauseating to think about. Hopefully some DLC will add some fun bosses but im seriously doubting it.

So there you go, hopefully that gives you some insight. Dont expect a life changing experience, expect; zombies, blood, knives, bikinis, brains and cheesy one liners. If you set your standards there you will thoroughly enjoy yourself.",4.0,B004PAGJOC,Its the cookie-cutter zombie murder mystery... and dammit its fun!,Video Games

"Teenagers Review:

I picked up this Nancy Drew game the minute I saw it, excited for a new Nancy game.  When I got home I had no trouble loading this game in.  I liked this Nancy Drew but I couldn't give it a 5 star because of the jobs you have to do.  Everyday you have to do the snack shop job or else you get three demerits, so there's one thing that is thrown in there to drag out this game.  Another thing is all the side jobs Nancy has to do for everyone.  Do someones DNA homework, take picture of everyone and load them up on the website, and when you think you done with that job you have to organize them and then your given another list of things to take pictures of.  You also have to prove this girl innocent of plagiarizing,and the last of Nancy jobs is to play air hockey or Scram with one girl when you need something from her.

"Legend of Legacy is a lot of fun, IF you enjoy games where you search out new locations to explore and level grind your attacks/defenses.  If you are looking for a RPG where you want a story driven RPG with character development, then you will be VERY disappointed.

I have been playing Legend of Legacy for about 10 hours now and the game basically goes like this....
1. Choose a main character (the computer will randomly select 2 other characters to join you)
2. Chart a map by exploring the different areas of that map
3. Kill monsters endlessly to level up your character's abilities in those areas
4. Sell completed maps to raise money to buy equipment, items and new maps for different areas of the island.
5. Try and guess when your character will unlock new abilities or level up existing ones.
6. Piece together a relative weak story by listening to stones that you find in each area.

This is a pick up and go game and I find enjoyment by exploring the different areas.  I have to actually use my imagination to fill in the gaps in the story, which actually, in this day in age, can seem very lame, but I enjoy it nonetheless.  I find myself trying to get 100% completion on each of my maps, which the game recommends you do anyway, just to get a sense of accomplishment.  It is not the best RPG on the 3DS and can actually be argued for being near the worst, but it has turn based combat and can be addictive to those, like myself, who enjoy endless grinding.

If you are a fan of RPG's then you will get more use out of this game than most.  I bought this on Amazon because it was cheaper than the full retail price.  I played the demo and wanted to experience the full game, without forking over the $40 MSRP.

Overall its addictive, fun and enjoyable to those who like grinding.",4.0,B00ZO1SO08,"Good portable RPG, but not the best,",Video Games

"Ah.. What have they done to you Vincent? Final Fantasy VII for the Playstation was an instant classic. Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children also received fine reviews. How then, could Dirge of Cerberus be bad? Well.. if it was done like this I guess.

This game is unique to the Final Fantasy world because it is an action game, not the usual RPG. Also, it stars a side character from an earlier game which hasn't been done yet either. However, in this case change isn't good. For starters many of the guns are basically the same thing. Of course there are a few differences, but none really too noticeable. Also, the action just becomes stale after awhile. Sure, the enemies change but it's never anything special. All you really have to do is click the R1 button a few times and they all die. Not to mention, the game designers seemed to try and make it as annoying as possible. There are constant loading and saving in the middle of the game that really bogs down the action. But, even after all these saves mid-mission death takes it's toll. You can run through three parts of a four part mission, waste a bunch of time doing boring gun fighting, and then die. And sometimes when you die, they send you all the way back to the start. ...That sucks.

Still, for fans of Final Fantasy the game does have some redeeming qualities. The CG cutscenes are beautiful and the story of Vincent Valentine is rather interesting. Still, when those cutscenes are just popping up two or three times every mission it can get a little tedious. Not to mention, there are load times between the cut scenes and the action. So, you have to wait through that as well.

It is also good to note, that it is cool to hear voices of the characters from a game from 1997. The music isn't too bad either. But, compared to Final Fantasy games from the past it really isn't anything to write home about. Overall, this game doesn't really last too long if you go through it quickly, like I did. But, after you beat the game there are a bunch of extra missons that you can take on for fun. I would have added more value for that, but Square decided to scratch the online portion of this game. That makes the additional missions mute.

A Final Fantasy fan will probably buy this game regardless of what I say. But, as a fan of the series I'd reccommend just renting it. You can easily play through the game in 5 days, and with no online or anything to make it worth keeping, the replay value isn't great. Dirge of Cerberus delivers on telling a story of a very popular side character, but fails at actually creating a decent shooter.",3.0,B000FDOTIQ,"Why Vincent, why?",Video Games

"I got this game because it was on sale for $40. I figured why not try it out for the sale price. I wanted to like this game because at the moment it is the only PS4 game I have. It's fun for a young child in my opinion. The reason I say this is because it is very repetitive. It's one of those games where you defeat all your enemies using the same moves over and over and over again. For kids this may be fun, but for teens and adults it can get boring quite fast. I usually play for only 15 minutes before I set the controller down and call it a night.

I'm a bit disappointed because, as I said, I wanted to like this game. I just have to be honest with myself. Repetition is not fun for long periods of time. You'll get bored quite quickly. Great for a child though.

EDIT: Just a quick update, I sold this game for $40 because I could just never get into it. I'm happy I got my money back.

"In case you're wondering, these are ""Metal Gear Solid 2 Substance"", ""Metal Gear Solid 3 Subsistence"" and ""Metal Gear Solid Peace Walker"".
All of them Trophy-compatible, full HD and everything you remember (except the Metal Gear Online of SubSistence). This is one of the few games that show you 1080 quality.
For the record (No C.o. D. M.W. 2 pun intended), this is the game that made me jump from the PSX simulator for PC to the actual PS2.

For Substance you get almost everything you could remember from the PS2 ver:
-Snake and Raiden playing with sunglasses every now and then
-Everything is the same in the interactive menus/cut-scenes
-The exact game play (excluding that sometimes the R2 and L2 are to be pressed a little harder for the tact-reload)
-Every VR mission (yes ALL OF 'EM and getting that trophy is deemed to be virtually impossible).
-Every special (boss survival, casting theater, etc)
-Snake Tales
-And last but not least, the Previous history, that, if you remember, includes the paper clipping, which upon reading unlocks a story published by a reporter, which in order unlocks the book by Dr. Nastasha Romanenko telling the story of Shadow Moses from her perspective.

Only one thing missing (that I know of, will edit if find something else), Skateboarding, there's no skateboarding in the HD Substance. Besides that, everything else you could remember from the PS2 Substance is here.

For Subsistence is almost the same:
-Again the exact game play (this one with the slight difference in the pressure sensitive ""CIRCLE""  that if you remember, is required precision to grab hold of an enemy and not slit his throat, hard core Subsistence/DualShock 2 users will take a while to empty that cup of knowledge to fill it with Dualshock 3 precision)
-Metal Gear Online is out, and I believe only a handful will miss it (not me for sure)
-Snake Vs Monkey (or whatever it's name was) is also gone, you can get the E Z gun with the alternate method, the hard way.
-The ""Special Conditions"" boss survival (Duel Mode I believe it was) is gone too (although you get the DPM camo from the get-go)
-The Nightmare sequence (the one you get when Para-Medic talks to Snake about a book after the torture sequence), is not here, or at least I don't know how to trigger it. The scene where Johnny talks of his family is here though, with stomach ache and everything.
-Secret Theater is also gone (bad thing because that joke on ""The Joy"" was priceless), maybe because they would have had to reanimate them again from scratch as they are not scenes for the game and thus not generated with the game engine.
-All the camos that were available for download (even DPM) are available from the Camouflage menu.
-Again all the interactions in menus/cutscenes are here, also the ones in the intro sequence (I even think there are more in the HD intro than in the PS2 ver); even all of them in the ""Press Start"" menu are there.
-And last but not-in the-least the Specials ""Metal Gear"" and ""Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake"" original vintage games that were included in PS2 Subsistence are here too. That is: You will be playing a NES game on a PS3! at 1080p.

In both of them you can still use what I call the ""Metal Gear reset method"", which is only holding START SELECT L1 L2 R1 R2 at the same time to get out the game to the game menu.

Two things that bothered me:
-You tap the Konami code and nothing happens. Even when it held no significance if you did input the code in the Konami logo it made the screen flutter a bit, like just thanking you for remembering, in Subsistence it did that and made a marking sound, but in the HD, nothing.
-----------EDIT-----------
The Konami code, still holds some power thought, If you enter the code in the pause menu, viewing the map, fighting the End (assuming you didn't kill him earlier), the code reveals his location and points it out on the map.
Thanks to Smolderin' Stu for the clarification
--------------------------
-American version button layout. Fans will remember that Metal Gear Solid, Metal Gear Solid 2 and Metal Gear Solid 3 were ones of the few that advanced on ""CIRCLE"" and backtracked on ""X"" in the menus, this appear to be ""fixed"" on the HDs. I particularly liked the exclusivity that this brought to this saga, it felt like it made you remember that this is a Japanese game.

For Peace Walker:
-I believe they did't take out anything (can't be sure since I didn't exactly completed all of those missions, just the main ops up to ZEKE, and a few of the extras after)
-Since it was made for PSP, you feel (or those of you who played it on PSP) that the menu is, like too big for the TV screen, big letters, big logos, but my brother got used to it after a while, as would most of us if we stopped playing it on PSP.

All three of them have the new ""Transfarring"" feature, that allow you to pause the game on PS3, save and continue on PSP or Vita (if you already have the PSP or vita version of the same game).

All in all still the best saga of video games I've ever played, and I consider this a must-have for all MGS fans

-----------EDIT-----------
A few years later. DON'T, and I really mean DO NOT USE THE TRANSFARRING OPTION! on Peace Walker
After I played it on PSP and transfarred it on to PS3, I found out that the trophies on PS3 won't work on a save game original from PSP (as one would have imagined) naturally.
But Konami went far and beyond; I was forced to start a new game on my PS3, then I transfarred it to continue it on my PSP, but when I transfarred it back to PS3 I then found out that I couldn't get any thropies on that savegame either.
So basically, DO NOT USE THE TRANSFARRING option if you ever want your trophies.

dislike: when you first turn on the wii u, in order to completely set up and be able to use the internet a download is required. This download is sensitive. it keeps disconnecting from server, and is very frustrating...

like: The game pad is awesome, and I love that they are using a rechargeable built in battery now so that you don't have to keep replacing the batteries like in the original wii control.

like: i like that you can use the game pad anywhere in the house.

pre-warning = if you don't have an hdmi port don't get the wii u. it requires an hdmi port instead of the usual av

revision:

I have the network figured out I think... if you keep the game pad control perfectly still it will not disconnect, or at least it didn't for me...

I am still keeping this as a 4 star review for flimsy network...

Revision:

I have been told that if you need the hdmi port, there is a av converter cord if you search amazon or somewhere...

Also, customer service said the network glitch only happens if your in the country or in an area that doesn't always have secure wi-fi... you can get it to work, but not as good... for me I live out in the country kind of... it's in the country/town part. we have cable internet, but for us to download the first download it literally took 8 hours since it kept disconnecting...

I started the download at noon, and it didn't finish until about 9:30. The best thing about it though is if it stops or you turn the system off, it'll pick up were it last left off...

if you have secure network you should be fine...

Also, customer service told me not to put the system or the game pad around metal objects because the metal interferes with it somehow...

"There are several things wrong with this game
Squad AI and enemy AI: This basically kills the game. The squad AI is so bad, the squad is a liability rather than an asset. Squad members will run out in front of you and block your shot, refuse to stay put when you tell them too, refuse to maintain distance and will therefore attract splash damage to you because they run up next to you, stand out in the open and just shoot away. The way the controls are set up, squad-mates are unnecessarily hard to issue orders to. For example, the game forces you to use a 'Biotic' power to destroy certain enemies. If you're a soldier you don't have access to these powers, so you have to use a squad-mate. To do so, you must have line of sight to the enemy that you want your squad-mate to destroy. WHY? How does this make any sense whatsoever? Why not just let the player switch control between characters like most RPGs of the 'recruit your squad-mates' variety do? Enemy AI is very primitive. While they us cover, it's very sparingly and they never do anything other than hold position or duck and weave between different cover. No grenade usage, no assault, nothing. BORING!
Sticky walls: ME1 decided to go with the '3rd person shooter duck and lean' system popularized by Gears of War. While it may work well on a console, here it's just annoying - you repeatedly stick to any bit of wall that you run into and un-sticking yourself is not smooth but you sort of have to pull yourself away. It's very annoying.
The Car & Mineral Collection: It's no fun to drive (in fact, it drives terribly and is very very aggravating) and they turn resource collection into a boring drive across empty terrain. If you don't do this, you can't buy the good stuff. So you just have to explore scores of worlds, driving across maps to find minerals. It's all very irritating and boring after the first time. The fact that this has to be done many many times made me decide to drop the game and stop playing it.
The BIOWARE recipe: Here's how it works - reveal a terrible calamity to the player. Have him move around the world collecting companions and harvesting resources by giving him boring, semi generic missions (the missions are basically identical between games. Try playing Dragon Age & KOTOR 1 alongside ME1 and you'll see what I mean). When he becomes Uber Powerful, lock him into a channeled sequence of events which culminates in him killing the boss in a (usually boring and repetitive shoot out so many body parts type) boss fight. We went there and did that with KOTOR 1 & 2, Dragon Age 1 & 2 and I hope by now people realize just how absolutely standardized all Bioware games are and how ME 1 stays true to this generic pattern.

In the end, my suggestion is to pass this game over in favor of more interesting titles.",1.0,B00140P9BA,Poorly implemented AI & bad game mechanics,Video Games
"This had to be the most boring game I ever played.  I couldn't wait to finish it and move on to a real game.  You learn a set of skills and basically use them through the rest of the game to do the same thing--enter (through hacking), fight, and hack a solution.  That's it.  And you can bypass most fighting by calling in other gangs to wipe out the opposition--so you really don't have to fight much either.  The network hack puzzles are so incredibly simple a 6-year old could figure them out. The clandestine entry using sets of tools reminded me of Dishonored--which is much much much better at handling hacks.  The use of multiple skills reminded me of Infamous Second Son, which changes the whole game 3 times over to get to the end so you have to adapt to upgraded skills as you go along--a much more enjoyable and challenging game than this.  And the swearing...every other word --even by random pedestrians on the street--is a swear word.  Does this make it seem ""edgy""?  No--makes it seem like you're trying to fool the audience into thinking this is a kicking action player when in fact its a slow, boring trek through simplistic exercises that your child could do, but you wouldn't let them because of the vulgarity.

"There is no question that with all the joy upon the Nintendo 3DS, and the hype that it has driven for gamers of all ages young and old. But that honestly doesn't mean that there are good accessories out there for the 3DS. For Dreamgear, they've made several stylus pens for the Nintendo DS systems over the years, but that honestly doesn't mean that they are worth their money. That also goes with this 3-pack of Dreamgear's stylus pens' made for the Nintendo 3DS. While it is a nice set of pens, it sadly doesn't work that well for the 3DS. Not only that, but also if you also own any of the past Nintendo DS systems, including the DSi XL, it really doesn't work as well here either. What I honestly do suggest is that you get the ones made from Nintendo instead. Not only are they worth the money, but keep everything aligned in 3D, that is truly 3D.

"This would be a great game, had Konami already not released five (six when the American Idol one comes out) better Karaoke games for the PS2. You would think that when releasing this game in 2006, Sony would look at its competition and make it equal or better. They did not. I apologize that so much of the review is comparing it to the Karaoke Revolution series, but it's a natural comparison, and unfortunate for Singstar Rocks, as SR is by far an inferior product.

I have a lot of the same complaints as others. There are no unlockables. Even though KR's strange costumes are seldom used in our household, it's nice to see things being unlocked as you sing more and better. Singstar Rocks does not do this.

The big thing is with the PS2 having two standard USB ports, why they would utilize the mini to USB adapter. This renders the mics useless to the KR games. If they're worried about being able to use an EyeToy simultaneously to two mics, maybe they should have included a USB mini hub instead. It infuriates me that with all the decent USB mics on the market that Sony again would go proprietary (of sorts).

Another complaint is the lack of adjustments. In song, KR (dating back to the original) allows you to adjust the vocals, mic and music. Singstar Rocks has only a master volume that doesn't see to do much.

It's also unfortunate that Sony stuck with only Sony artists, as they are missing out on a ton of others. The song selection is very random due to this and a couple are very strange selections to have on a sing along disc. There are multiple songs on here that do not make a lot of sense. Of all the Rolling Stones catalog, why would Forty Licks' ""Paint it Black"" be the one to appear. Lame!

In a vacuum, the game is fun, but its song selection, lack of options and its proprietary options all make it fall extremely short to any of the other Karaoke Revolution. Don't waste your time with this one. Get *any* of the KR series over this one.",2.0,B00004TNEY,Karoake Revolution,Video Games

"The strength of the story makes up for its blah gameplay. Its a cover shooter same control schemes as Uncharted or Gears. There is some mediocre squad command tactics, with on on rail shooting in helicopters and trucks. The game tries to make it so that sand is a factor, unless your squad mates point out that a wall can be shot out you won't end up doing it. The guns and ammo are plentiful enough usually you will be out of ammo or close to after you have cleared the area. I like the fact that you can cancel your grenade throw instead of wasting it when the foes are gone.

The story is where you buy the game. It  has a very good Apocalypse Now, Heart of Darkness. There are multiple endings one is far better then the other and there are multiple endings to one of the multiple endings, say that five times fast. You lead a team to search and rescue the US army battalion that tried to save the city from a horrific sand storm. The lead character Captain Walker goes insane as he searches for the leader of the army battalion. The story line was dark with a lot of mess up scenes. The ending really made me appreciate some of the stuff the game put me through. And spoiler white phosphorous.

It had an ok multiplayer but the community wasn't there. Its one of the few games that I found all that collectibles. The intel you find delves deeper into the minds of the characters with audio logs and personal opinions of picked up items. Its definitely not a 60 dollar purchase its about 40 or 30 now and that seems more appropriate. For those looking at a different take on the modern shooter this was surprisingly good.",4.0,B00320JAWY,Spec Ops Review,Video Games
"So this memory card is the largest on the Vita.  I have 8 GB left after 11 months of owning a Vita.  No question that you pretty much have to have a 32 GB card.
Pros-
Small

Has lots of memory left after a year of use

Cons-

When I remove it to show family members who are curious about the Vita, I plug it back in and all the bubbles moved.  Annoying.

So I get it.  Not all memory cards have exactly the amount of GB's they say on it.  My 4 GB memory stick actually has 3.82 GB's.  This memory card has 3 GB's less than what they advertise.  You truly only have 29 GB.

I know this has nothing to do with the actual memory card's performance, but it does hurt the Vita. The price.  I think there are 2 reasons that the Vita struggles (I happen to love my Vita and think everyone should get one) First reason is the PSP.  People didn't like the PSP Go (I think) and they are not going to buy a Vita because of it.  Good job Sony.  The second reason it is failing is because of the memory card prices.  When i bought this memory card it was like $75.  It has gone up in price.  Well done Sony.  Anyways you are basically forced to buy the 32 if you only want 1 memory card, even then you may need 2.

"My husband gave this to me as a gift so we could play together.  There are several interface problems that really interfered with the fun we know we can have with these games.  First, difficult switching between players to see our ""rooms"" and ""awards"" -- you have to add and remove people.  Second, over sensitivity and under sensitivity both with the controller so that what you point at changes or your actions are difficult to control.  Third, Mr. Potato Head gets repetitive quickly and his controlling the viewpoint is annoying.  Finally we are very annoyed that we can't choose our own color of pawns for games -- we have established colors we use on these sorts of things offline and it would be nice to use the same on the game.

Now there are good things, too,though I must mix them with more criticisms to be honest.  The ""Battleship"" graphics are fun though frankly they could be zoomed in more.  We like the shaking of the dice for ""Yahtzee"" but again we wish it had a ""triple"" option since that is the version we like best.  The timer and word list for Boggle is a good touch, frees us from a timer and dictionary but we wish it could zoom in more and we noticed the words are censored -- perfectly good words are not allowed sometimes simply because they may have a ""vulgar"" connotation.

"Some Windows XP systems (such as mine) will experience constant crashing. As in every couple of minutes, or every time you save. I can still manage to play by saving (it usually crashes after you save, luckily), quitting if it didn't crash, and restarting, but that gets old after a few hundred repetitions. Funcom doesn't seem interested in releasing a fix for the problem or acknowledging that it exists.

It also sometimes stops responding to the mouse if you switch to another application (such as an instant message popping up), and the textures always get hosed if you switch, so that also is effectively a crash.

Also, saved games in the first slot cannot be restored, so you may find yourself confused at the very beginning.

It's a bit long-winded... sort of the longest-winded journey, and you may want to use subtitles so you can read parts and then right click in the dialog or hit escape to skip to the next audio segment.

"We've been getting and enjoying Tiger Woods games for many years now. Every year the graphics improve and the greens look more realistic. With this high def version, you almost feel like you are at the locations.

They seem to have made this game more ""user friendly"" to try to bring in non-golfers. I can understand that mentality, but it means that we actually prefer the '07 gameplay a bit more than this one.

For example, let's take golf ball spin. When you hit a ball in the real world, often new players will swing from outside to inside which creates a slice. You can also swing from inside to outside to create a left-to-right bend. So in the previous game the joystick would mimic this - if you accidentally slanted the joystick while you pushed it, the ball would spin. However with '09 you do that through commands. That is, it no longer cares how well you ""swing"" in the game. I find this to be a step backwards.

The in-game challenges are fun. You have one long string of players you can challenge - and you can take on whatever ones you have enough points to take on.

Your skill is now based on how well you play. If you start hitting the ball accurately, your accuracy skill gets higher. So as you build up real in-game skills, the stats of your character reflects that.

The graphics and sounds are, of course, stunning. You really can immerse yourself into the golf world, listen to the sounds of the course around you, watch the clouds drifting, and feel like you are there. Yes, I'd recommend being on an ACTUAL course and getting some exercise - but how about when it's rainy? Snowy? Lightning storms? This is the perfect alternative to keep your golf interests well tuned until you can actually get out onto that green grass again.

So a few minor complaints, but I understand why they made the changes.

Well recommended.",5.0,B00160HY3E,"Great graphics, good gameplay",Video Games
"People say one of the drawbacks for this game is--because it is too much like Roller Coaster Tycoon. However, I, a lover of almost all simulation games and Roller Coaster Tycoon, I disliked this game. Unless you find the concept exciting, do NOT buy this game.
Unlike Roller Coaster Tycoon the scenarios are much more boring and broad and after a while (for me, two or three hours) the game became monotanous and boring. It was definately not worth the money and now it is sitting on a quiet dusty shelf.
Also, unlike Roller Coaster Tycoon this game appeals to younger age groups. My friend's on (12 yrs. old) loves this game with a passion.
So to conclude, I would only recommend buying this game if.....

"I have been a very long time Grognard.  For you young folks reading this and haven't the foggiest idea what a Grognard is, it is someone who enjoys playing board wargames, particularly the cardboard counter-heavy, hex overlaid paper game board, strategy wargames from the 1970s.

As technology and computer advances relegated us, old-soldiers, to past history, several computers games appeared designed to attract us.  These games were turn-based, multi-dimensional, operational control, involving strategy above all.  In truth, very few computer games ever came close to satisfying us old-timers.  There were some notable stand outs.  The original X-Com games are one of these.

X-Com was my first favorite computer game and still holds that position though it is tied with the Fallout series.  As I own all the old X-Com games I have attempted to use Dosbox to bring them back to life.  My computer skills are very limited to say the least and my results were less than pleasing.  I have been bugging Good Old Games (.com) to do their magic and re-release them, to no avail.  Imagine my surprise when I found, not one, but all five of the X-Com games in one package, right here on Amazon.com.  All right, so perhaps you cant imagine--so suffice it to say I was exceptionally pleased and excited.

The X-Com Collection is released as a download only, as far as I can tell.  The graphics, while still the simpler renditions of early '90s computer graphics, are crisp and clear.  Gameplay is smooth and of yet I haven't experienced any crashes in the program.  It plays just as I remember.  I started playing once the download was completed yesterday morning and I have only taken a couple of breaks until I stopped to eat and write this review.

The only downside for me is the need to use 'Steam' to host the game on-line, requiring you to be connected when you want to play.  For many of you, 'Steam' is an accepted and familiar requirement and won't be an issue.  Even with a distasteful taste in my mouth when having to deal with 'Steam' games, the download and setup took less than twenty minutes and went rather smoothly.

Game play consists of taking operational control over a world wide organization assigned to detect, investigate and untimely stop the invasion of earth by aliens.  You start with one base, with limited operational abilities, two top of the line air interceptors and a team of eight rookie soldiers attached to a high speed transport aircraft.  You control pretty much everything under your command.  You recruit new soldiers and purchase their gear.  You bring in scientists and engineers to research and build advanced items based on captured alien technology.  (Your starting base has a laboratory and a workshop with ten scientists and ten engineers)

You can build additional buildings which house large radar systems, alien containment cells, and additional living space, hangars, workshops and labs.  You can use your two Interceptors to patrol the skies to locate alien aircraft.  When the alert comes you send your Interceptors to shoot down the intruder with your squad of soldiers right behind.  With the alien space craft crashed on the ground, you send your soldiers in for a closer look. As you advance into the crash site much of the area is in darkness until you can maneuver your troops to get their eyes on the darkened areas.  You have control of each of your team members, who you can arm with pistols, rifles, grenades, smoke, high explosives, auto-cannons and auto-guns and even a tank.  As your scientists discover the secrets of the alien technology you can arm your soldiers with high tech weapons and advanced body armor.  Simply sending your interceptors out to ""splash"" the alien space craft isn't enough.  You must get your teams ""boots on the ground"" in order to capture the alien technology and beat them back from whence they came.

As the game continues you get to build additional bases, bring in more staff and soldiers.  You also have to keep the nations of the world happy with your progress as they are the ones who provide the vast amount of funds required to keep this operations in the black.  Fail to intercept a few alien missions into Russia, and suddenly you find Russia is only offering pennies for your funding.

So...if you want a taste of the great tactical games from years gone by, I strongly recommend X-Com: Collection as a natural and top choice.  To all I wish happy gaming.",5.0,B00846E6X4,X-Com Collection - Fantastic!!,Video Games

"First of all I love Just Dance games and own all of the main series ones for the Wii and Wii U. This game is no different from the last released one (Just Dance 4) except it comes with different songs. Most of the songs are pretty great but I did not like the fact that all the ""really good"" songs needed to be bought in the Nintendo eShop. Most the songs costs $2.99 each which can make this game end of costing a lot in the long run. I got this used for about half the price of the new version and I've had no problems with it PLUS I still was able to download the Katy Perry track for FREE!

If you haven't played any Just Dance games before it's just a dancing game where you follow the on screen dancers. It's pretty easy and is mostly played for fun or used as a workout. I personally have lost a lot of weight playing these games. I enjoy dancing to the music as well. Some songs are recently released hits while others range from popular ""party"" songs and older hits.

I gave this game 4 out of 5 stars because although it's a great dancing game (which I love) I don't like the fact that they make you pay for all the ""good"" songs. The game comes with some songs that aren't that great but they really force you to pay if you want to dance to the popular songs. I recommend this game to anyone that has played any Just Dance game before and like it.

"So I recently bought this because I have yet to really play a newer Pokemon game. With X & Y being the first to introduce 3D I felt like the change from the original to now was so great that I'd be blown away by that alone. Just as I thought, after playing on this new 3DS, I have to say this is the best hand-held system I've ever owned. I am 26 years old so when the originals came out I was about 9, so this is a huge nostalgia trip for me. My first experience into Pokemon was unforgettable and thanks to this system, my new foray into the newest generation of games was also unforgettable.

This is my first 3DS system, as before I didn't care for the two screen design. Now though, I've come to terms with the functionality the 2nd screen adds and thus find this incredibly intuitive. The system operates flawlessly, feels absolutely amazing and substatial in my hands. When my wife bought me this she also bought my brother one so we could play together, unfortunately he was only able to get the generic N3DS XL version. It is also his first 3DS system and he says he loves it as well.

After playing with mine for a weekend and observing him play on his XL, I have to say I'm incredibly thankful I got this size of 3DS. I wouldn't have liked the XL simply because it's like holding a giant tablet, to me doesn't feel hand-held, instead it seems like it needs to be propped up. In the end I think the XL is just too big for me, I prefer smaller devices (considering we're not in 1980 anymore) and this one is just that; much smaller.

The plates came with Charizard pre-intalled, just had to snap on the top plate (didn't take much force either). The pre-installed versions of Blue & Red are much appreciated as it adds to the level of nostalgia. I also plan on using it as a wow factor for family. ""Hey ya'll check out what Pokemon looked like 20 years ago, and now!"" I can just see their faces of disbelief (as I'm sure I had when I first turned this on). What makes this the biggest nostalgia trip for me is the exact same art of Charizard and Blastoise from the original games. That art is simply priceless and never gets old to admire and look at. The device also comes with a free download of the Red & Blue Pokemon themes for the 3DS which plays the Pokemon theme song (from the game) in the background and adds Pokemon to the wallpaper. All in all, this is incredibly worth it, but I'd recommend buying this locally, I was able to find it at a local Fred Meyer for $175, but like I said before my brother wasn't able to get one because there was only 1 left. So, if you can manage to find this locally, and love Pokemon, then I suggest getting this. WARNING - there is no charger! I didn't know this because I haven't ever bought a 3DS before and was too excited to read the dumb box. Wasn't a huge deal, popped over to Wal-Mart and picked up an AC charger for $10. So for $185 I got this and the charger, I'm a happy camper!

"Gameplay: The first thing that makes a video game is obviously gameplay. I was able to enjoy 80 hours of Final Fantasy XIII before I got fed up with it. The reason being; was because there was lots to unlock and several things to do even upon passing the video game. The biggest disappointment (statistically) is the way battles are fought. If the party leader should K.O during a battle, then it's a game over. One other thing I found to be another flaw was the summoning system; each character has their own assigned Eidolon. This means, you may just have to use your least favorite character , just to summon your favorite Eidolon. There are several other gameplay aspects that may disappoint, but there are also several things that make up for it. I still stand by the side of FFXIII due to it's amazing story and characters. You just have to bare with getting through a bunch of chapters with the hardship of fighting with just 2 characters for the most part of the game. THERE IS A LOT OF CHARACTER SWITCHING! Which you have no control over till the end of the game.

Graphics: The graphics in this game are by far beautiful! If you don't have an HDTV or any form of HD access, you won't reap the full benefit of playing Final Fantasy XIII. Graphics of this game are what fill a hole in it's many flaws. This game is almost HD to it's fullest extent.

Storyline: This is the main reason I had purchased Final Fantasy XIII (thus why I've purchased any Final Fantasy.)It's one of the more mellow stories told in the FF series, also it's something very different. Each character is somehow connected. I loved the storyline- it was well built and given the best characters ever. I really enjoyed it; I'm sure several others out there will.

Overall: I give this game a 5, because it's one of my favorite Final Fantasy's since 7. Even though it's flawed in many ways; there are things I just love about this game. I forgot to mention how great the music is in this game. The only disappointment is it's gameplay, which I didn't mind much- but give it a shot! I bought it when it first came out at it's introductory price; I would say the price it's at now is well worth it.

"This was overall a fun game with an allright story. It was long enough to more than satisfy me and the graphics were really nice, although I do have a couple complaints.

The characters are not very in depth, with the exception of Jansen. The rest of the characters are pretty dull in personality.
Also, I don't feel that there was enough strategy.
The only system of battle tactics that's basically needed to win consists of offensive and defensive buffing and powerful black magic spells. The hardest battles were few: like the snake at the beginning of the game, and the boss of the labyrinthe temple(whatever it was called). The battles were challenging, but the basic strategy never really changed, and the battles were overall kind of boring. All the spells were unoriginal and nothing more than light shows. I found the temple near the end of the game super tedious, and I was relieved when I finally found my way through that ridiculous maze. The biggest thing that let me down is the last boss fight. I fought him for what seemed like an hour or more, but he really didn't put a dent in my HP at all. It was so easy it was just dumb, but yet I'm still fighting for an hour through numerous cut scenes of rising tensions, waiting for the hard part, on the edge of my seat...but it never came. He just died. How stupid!
I gave this a 4 because it was intriguing for the most part all the way through the game, with several interesting twists, and the ship reminded me of FF8, which I love. Definitely a time consumer, and that is NOT a bad thing at all. I do recommend this game for any rpg fans.",4.0,B000ZJVDA2,Disappointed in the ending~,Video Games

"Been playing PC games using Logitech Dual-Action Gamepads (both rumble and non-rumble versions) as well as their gaming mice for nearly 20 years.  I've had maybe six over that time, the last two were model G-UF13a, and they were excellent (until they crapped out).  Logitech gamepads are generally very durable, but when they fail it is invariably the same mechanism (at least for me); sticking left joystick function for movement in a particular direction.  Guess they just wear out after millions of thumb movements.  Anyway, bought this F310 as Logitech's recommended replacement.

Pros:
- Sized about the same as the older versions and buttons/sticks are in the same places, feels about the same
- Seamless installation, downloaded latest software from the Logitech site and the controller immediately recognized my old game button programming
- Good price on Amazon

Cons:
- Trigger buttons have an annoying ""clack"" that wasn't there on older gamepads
- Cord is a few inches shorter than on the older controllers I had
- Lower left and right trigger buttons are mechanically differently than on older Logitech controllers.  They are an angled, swing-type actuation rater than the simple soft-button push of their older controllers.  This is why I can't give 5 stars to this controller.  I know it sounds like nit-picking; but if you use those buttons a lot and have been accustomed to the older trigger configuration that was used on Logitech's PC controllers for nearly two decades, it's an annoyance that old f*rts like me don't need.  It's a longer button push to get the functions to work, and then there's that annoying clack at the end.

Bottom line; I can recommend this controller (with reservations about the trigger buttons).  I'm sure I'll eventually get used to the button clack and the different triggers; but I'm a little disappointed in Logitech for not offering a better product.",4.0,B003VAHYQY,Adequate; but Logitech could do better,Video Games

"Kids really liled this game. It's a ""must have"" for fans of Lego titles.
My only remark about it that didn't allow me to give it a 5 stars, is that the logic of the game is kind of confusing.
As for the other titles where the natural game development shows by itself what do you have to do to get the other playable characters (actually the only thing that keep my kids challenged and tied up to the game); for this one even for me it's kind of confusing and non-sense to find out what to do or where to go to move ahead on the game. Kids are not that patient and may get tired easily because of that.
Lego's titles are becoming way too complex since our own Star Wars III-Clone Wars experience. And seriously, we prefered the old humming Legos over these new bla-bla ones.
But beyond that its very nice to meet the bunch of new super heroes and villains and hear classic and different tunes of the game as Superman's main theme.

"[I want to apologize for making this review so long, but I felt as though this game needed to be explained thoroughly.]
Mega Man X6(2001). Part six of seven.
After the somewhat disappointing X5, another sequel appeared less than a year later. How is this possible? According to another reviewer, apparently both X5 and X6 were created at the same time by two different teams under Capcom. For the most part, X6 is a combination of X5's style and X3's complexity. It contains the same graphics and classic gameplay as the previous two X games, but there are several features to this game that set it apart from the others. Here's the breakdown:
PROS:
-THANKFULLY, THERE ARE NO MORE MANDATORY ALIA MESSAGES! Capcom realized this mistake from X5 and made this feature optional. A small ""!"" appears in the corner when you reach key points in the stage and if you ever need them (true MM junkies don't) just press select. Finally, we get completely uninterrupted gameplay!
-The difficulty has been Vamped up drastically. This can be a good thing and a bad thing (more on the bad later). The good thing is that the game is no longer a cake-walk to beat like X4 and X5. The enemies will definitely give the player something to keep busy with.
-Perhaps the most non-linear X game in the series. By that I mean all the levels are vast, containing two different exits, and large arena-rooms to explore. Plus, the secret items are all cleverly scattered. You have to do more thinking than ever before to obtain some of them.
-The sound effects are slightly different than before. Now the explosions really let out a BANG! Also, some of the stage tunes are a return to X4's techno hardrock style, namely the Heatnix, Wolfgang, Mijinion, and Shark stages.
-Rescuing the 128 different reploids. This adds even more depth to X6 and allows the player to gain enhancements by rescuing them.
-X can now use the Z-saber! While it is not very good as a rapid attack weapon, it does help to reflect projectiles in the heat of combat.
CONS
-Okay, now the bad thing about the difficulty: SOME AREAS IN THE GAME LEAD TO POINTLESS FRUSTERATION. When I say that enemies come in endless waves, I mean that they throw everything and the kitchen sink at you. It comes to the point where even a veteran MM gamer cannot make it through each stage without losing lives. THE NIGHTMARE SYSTEM DOES NOT HELP THIS. Often times annoyances like meteors, fireflies, blackouts, and impassible silver blocks will take more effort to get through than normal stage enemies, which is nonsense. AND ITS ALL RANDOMLY GENERATED.
-THERE ARE TOO MANY NIGHTMARE ENEMIES. In some stages like the museum, most every enemy you face will be one of those. A little more variety in the bestiary would have benefited.
-Besides the four tracks I mentioned, the rest of the music is dull, boring, popish, and often annoying. I personally cannot stand the museum stage tune. AND WHAT'S WITH THE GRUNGE INTRO TRACK? This does not even fit with the X universe!
-LEVELS ARE NOT RANDOMLY GENERATED LIKE THE BOX CLAIMS. Okay Capcom, I don't care if the levels were actually random or not, but it's a really bad move to make a boast about a feature that's not there.
-Once again, the bosses are rather easy to beat. This is a bit of a letdown after how incredibly hard some of the stages are. Contrary to this though, the mini-boss High Max, seems almost too difficult to beat.
-Like the whale stage in X5, THE REPEATING JUNK-BALL MINI BOSS IN HEATNIX'S STAGE GETS TEDIOUS AFTER GOING THROUGH THE STAGE MORE THAN TWICE. It hurts the most when you're going back to rescue just one reploid.
-The story pretty much shot down the drain with this game. The cutscenes, though voice-acted in Japanese, drag on for a looooooong time. Like I said with X5, BRING BACK THE ANIME CUTSCENES! Zero should either be here to stay or gone for good. None of this ""dramatic death and resurrection"" junk. One other thing, STOP RESURRECTING SIGMA! Play X6 for the gameplay itself, not the story.
-Once a reploid gets caught by a nightmare, he can never be rescued again. In order to get him back, you have to reload the game. This can get annoying with some reploids.
-X can obtain two excellent pairs of armor (Blade, and Shadow), BUT GETTING THEM REQUIRES YOU TO ENDURE THE RANDOM NIGHTMARE SYSTEM UNTIL THE RIGHT HAZARD COMES ALONG IN A PARTICULAR STAGE. You can't acquire anything else without them.
X6 as a whole is a fun, challenging, and more often than not, a frusterating game. However I only recommend this one to experienced gamers, as this is one of the hardest MM titles to date. With a bit more work, this game could have easily been a classic. Despite all the shortcomings, it succeeds in retaining the classic 2D gameplay that makes Mega Man games what they are. I'm only being so critical on this game because I am an incredibly big MM fan who cares about the series. The story is the weakest part of X6, but give the game a chance. It's at least worth playing through one time. Get equipped with bubble lead all over again and go give it a shot.",4.0,B00005NCCZ,A good X game that had the potential to be great,Video Games
"While most gamers (including myself) have become a bit jaded with all the bells and whistles out there, all the convoluted plots, etc....sometimes you just want a game that is fun, easy to use and play, that isn't so technical and pissy that you get a bug if you look at it the wrong way. This is that game. It's online options are limited, and it's storyline is simple but not boring. The ease of use with the controls and the sheer fun of playing a dogfight style space shooter through GORGEOUS spacescapes makes this game one of the best of it's kind currently. It's a game I've finished several times and still find myself coming back to. Unlike many games, this one is still playable after you win the main story. My only regret here is that there isn't more of it, of that it isn't likely to receive a sequel. It'd sure get my vote if it did.

"Costing as much as fifty dollars new at the time, I nevertheless was suckered into buying two of these back in 1999 or so when I played my N64 a lot.

The thing is insanely sensitive and easy to break.  The first stupid thing it does is in its use, you put the Gameshark into the slot, then stick the game up on top of it.  As with many cartridge game systems, it seems you need to wiggle it about, and position it just right just for it to work.  I remember spending several minutes during the last leg of my first Gameshark's life trying to adjust the game on top to be slightly lop-sided, because it simply would not work if I just pushed the cartridge down all the way, like it's supposed to.

Of all the functions it has, half of them don't even work.  The function of basically making up new cheat codes based on gameplay regularly froze up games, and at worst, caused catastrophic damage to the Gameshark.  I remember one instance I tried to create a new cheat code, and ended up filling up my entire Gameshark's memory with useless information.  Almost none of the pre-set games and codes worked, names were screwed up with random characters and letters, and largely I had to just guess which code would do what for which game.

The fifteen minute instructional VHS that came with the Gameshark was a hilarious joke---both VHS's had the little plastic tab on the bottom STILL INTACT!  If you still remember how VHS's work, this means ANYONE CAN RECORD OVER THE VHS IF THE PLASTIC TAB IS STILL INTACT!  I could literally have recorded gay porn over the VHS, packaged it with the Gameshark, sent it back for a refund, and they likely would have sent the VHS in a new package to be sold to someone else!

Whatever benefits the Gameshark gives are simply not worth it in the long run.  It doesn't ruin your game permanently, but it ruins itself just fine.  There was never any justified reason for the way my two Gamesharks just simply broke down and stopped working.",1.0,B00000K4E1,Breaks too easily for a grotesque sum of money,Video Games

"South Park is one heck of an icon when it comes to comedy, but it may very well become an icon in the gaming world with the latest entry of the South Park games, The Fractured But Whole. I pre-ordered this game digitally and managed to get South Park Stick of Truth. As a South Park experience, it was exceptionally good. But unfortunately as a game, it was pretty underwhelming. The turn base combat was fine, I like that feeling of a classic RPG, but it was extremely easy that the game felt more like an interactive movie. Because of this, the game felt short as well, I honestly think the game took me around 6 hours to beat. Which as for a free download for pre-ordering the new game is fine, but I'd be lying if I said ""I wasn't expecting more."" The Fractured But Whole on the other hand actually felt more like a game while still having that South Park charm. See when I was playing the Stick of Truth, I used a lot of my already knowledge of RPG titles to essentially look every inch and cranny for special gear, equipment, and other items and it was like no matter what I collected, the only things that had use was the armor and the ""Junk"" you collected was... just that, junk. Throughout a majority of that playthrough I kept hold of everything because I thought there would be a crafting system, but reality they were all useless items that were made to only be sold to vendors. The Fractured But Whole actually is the opposite. This time, the equipment you wear has no effect on your character and you can look like however you like to. And the ""Junk"" this time around are crafting items as the game this time includes a crafting system. Though you'll have to buy recipes from vendors, but this time every item you pick up has some form of use. For those who think that the ""No Stats on Equipment"" may be a problem, don't worry it's not. This time your stats are all based on Artifacts that you can either find in the game, or craft on your own assuming you found the recipe. And as you level up, you'll gradually unlock new slots to add more artifacts, but there is a limit so it's not like you'll be able to equip every single artifact in the game. And the combat, the combat is probably what makes this game feel more like a game... well in comparison with Stick of Truth that is. I mentioned that the Stick of Truth was simple and easy, but what I didn't mention was how easy. The affliction status the game had (Shock, Bleed, Gross-Out, and Freeze) were fairly easy to abuse and take out opponents, making much of the game a walkthrough, even on the hardest difficulty. While the Fractured but Whole still includes these affliction statuses, they're not as common as it would be as instead of a turnbase RPG, it's more of a tactical RPG. You have to plan your moves and your attacks with the board you're on. And with each game having at least 8 characters on the field (you, 3 teammates, and 4+ opponents) you'll likely won't get every affliction on one opponent like you would in Stick of Truth. I've talked a lot of positives, what about negatives? Well there are some. First gripe, despite this game feeling like it has more challenge than it's predecessor, Ubisoft can ruin it and make your game experience a walkthrough. Ubisoft Club is implemented in The Fractured But Whole (just like every Ubisoft Published game) and it includes artifacts that are quite powerful to have both early and late game. And it may seem cool to get the Assassin's Creed Outfit plus Hidden Blade Artifact, that Hidden Blade Artifact can make a hard run be normal at worst, especially when you also equip the other two artifacts that are also offered in Ubisoft Club. What's more is these Artifacts can be upgraded in the crafting menu and all the requirements you need are... just the artifacts themselves. Well at least you also have to level up your crafting skill, but honestly it's not hard to pull off so you can pretty much bulldoze your way through the game. Another slight negative is this game... kind of takes place after the last season of South Park, Season 20; also known as the Story Season that not many liked. The Fractured But Whole will have Member Berries to find over Chinpokomon, and PC Principal is present too... but they're not that heavy noted in the game. I mean I don't like PC Principle but you really interact with him twice and that's it. But still, this could leave a sour taste in a few people's mouths as Season 20 wasn't all that hot. So is the Fractured But Whole worth it? Well even though I got nearly over double the hours compared to Stick of Truth, I think getting Fractured But Whole alone will be best when it goes on sale, maximum of $40. But if you happen to manage to find a physical copy of the game that includes Stick of Truth, then yeah I can safely say that this is a recommended purchase. South Park The Fractured But Whole is a great South Park game, better than the Stick of Truth in opinion. And the game has a lot of South Park references (New and Old) that wasn't featured in Stick of Truth. If you're a hardcore South Park fan, you'll certainly get a kick out of the game, as well as some laughs.",4.0,B00ZJBSCJQ,The Game Might be a Pun But I Could Be Wrong,Video Games
"Finally taking a break from being overshadowed by demented Rabbids, Rayman finally stars in another platforming adventure. And BOY was this an unexpected turnout! There were a lot of times in which I thought this was too good to be true. No way could a game have such amazing 2D visuals, a gorgeous soundtrack, and incredible gameplay to match with everything alike. It would have to be a beyond-MIRACLE to obtain something like that.

But I couldn't be happier to say that this game fits that bill! The gameplay is very simple - You jump, you punch/kick, you collect Lums, you do whatever it takes to go and rescue the trapped beings in them big cages. However, as simple as it sounds, it is amazingly executed. There are loads of elements that keep the flow of the gameplay at its max it's freaking unbelievable! Just watch the least bit of footage possible and you'll be amazed!

Again, the graphics are EYE-POPPING! This is the finest 2D graphics could go! Everything's all hand-drawn and cartoon-y! Just thinking about it makes my mind thrive with cheerfulness! I absolutely love this look! See the boxart? The game looks just like that! And the soundtrack makes those visuals even more appealing, yet it also adds to the game by itself.

There's so much about this game that I totally find awesome that I just can't put it all in one review (EX: I may as well mention now that there's a HILARIOUS intro when starting a new game). So, if you're still concerned, either go read other reviews or watch videos of the game being played. I prefer the latter.

Overall, this is as close to flawless as it gets. If you are a platformer fan, you'd be just plain crazy to pass this up! Heck, it makes Rayman 2 (Who some claim to be one of the best 3D platformers) look like complete crap! Yeah, I said it.

"Okay, so this is my second NES clone that I've bought. Last year I purchased the Yobo FC. It was a decent enough system, but its biggest flaw is what finally did it in; the connector is too tight! My copy of Zelda 2 always seemed to get stuck in there and eventually the system's connector broke on one side. I glued it and it lasted many months after but finally the other side broke and I decided it was time for a new system.

First off, the controllers that come with this system suck! They're ugly, I don't like the shape, the layout, the feel anything. Luckily I have quite a few original controllers including the MAX, Dogbone, and Zapper and all of those work great!

The actual system however is fantastic. I like the actual look of it, seems like they tried harder than other clones to capture a look that goes with the NES and its accessories, especially with the ridges going across it.

The connector isn't too tight a fit like the Yobo and all my games come off of it with little effort! Also there's minor things in the performance I notice. The sound seems just a tiny bit better as well as the video.

All in all, this is a great system that I definitely recommend above all the other clones!",5.0,B000MFHH6I,Much better than the Yobo FC,Video Games
"Love the console... runs very quiet. The MCC collection plays smoothly at 60 fps and I have not run into any major lag at all. It truly is every Halo enthusiast's dream come true. The only reason why this isn't a five star purchase is because the controller became defective about half hour into playing. Something snapped inside on the RT thumbstick and now sensitivity is suboptimal while aiming. I'm hoping I can resolve this minor set back quickly with MS... quite dissappointing to say the least. Never had this issue with Sony accessories. Xbox 360 controllers also had similar issues, with stick drift etc. Other than that i'm quite happy with my purchase.
Edit: Managed to exchange my controller directly from the MS store for a new special forces edition wireless one. Quick and painless... and it's working efficiently. Although I should mention I did get MS complete warranty for the console. In any case... this was a good deal, considering I got the Witcher 3(some of the best visuals I have seen)  with the free game promotion as well. Something I've noticed... after several games on the MC collection. Halo 3 seems to have considerable preference over all the other games. More than likely you'll be playing about 70% of Halo 3 matches. Which is fine I suppose, though it does get redundant after a while... Halo 3 is great fun... just has some flaws... you still have to lead your shots with the BR, same with sniping... it's strange. As if auto aim was completely off. Kinda similar to Halo CE actually.

"There is much to admire in THQ's latest release of ""Summoner"" for the PC.  This RPG has some of the best graphics and three-dimensional visualization I've seen in the past year.  The sets are quite complex and offer some breathtaking viewpoints.  Opponents are well animated with a variety of moves.  Cut scenes are abundant, and are a major source of continuity.  Sound design is exceptional as well.
The story itself is straightforward.  Joseph, born a summoner has fled to the village of Masad after his undisciplined use of his summoning skill calls a demon that destroys his home village of Ciran.  Unfortunately Murod, the evil emperor of Orenia has heard a prophecy that a summoner will destroy him and is searching for Joseph.  The story opens will Masad's destruction at the hands of imperial forces and Joseph's flight to the capital city of Lenele where he will seek his old mentor and try to regain control over his own fate.
The first part of the story takes place in Lenele's streets, sewers and buildings as Joseph gains in skill and power while he begins to assemble his party.  Soon thought he is out in the world of Khosos traveling to other cities and facing random (and not so random) conflicts.  There are many side quests, which provide sources of experience while Joseph and his friends struggle to stop the onslaught of Murod and his hideous generals.  Joseph's team will grow to include Flece, a master thief, Rosalind a mage of the Order of Iona and Jekhar who became Joseph's sworn enemy when Ciran was destroyed.
""Summoner"" is a large game, with a lot of enemies to defeat.  There are plenty of opportunities for hacking and slashing as well as spell casting.  Joseph's special ability to summon demons and Flece's thieving add extra dimension.  Bugs are few and far between.  Altogether a very effective conversion of a PS2 game.
There are a few drawbacks though.  Combat and control are a bit awkward, and take a lot of getting used to.  There's simply too much mousing around to do.  As a result battles drag out.  The fighting AI's are pretty good, but the players running on auto are prone to run off and do the wrong thing just when you want them to follow the leader and sneak by some potential trouble.  A few scenes get repeated a bit too often (I think I had to fight my way through Lenele's sewers four or five times).  If you leave the viewpoint on auto it has a habit of picking bad angles of vision.  All of these things act as irritants.  Towards the end it's a real temptation to start up a trainer and let the game run on auto as much as possible.
OK, ""Summoner"" isn't perfect.  But its overall quality is pretty impressive.  2001 has been a dry year so far and ""Summoner"" provides many hours of good gameplay.

"Then this is it!  This is the best online game for the PS2 so far.
Pros:
Great Graphics
Deep gameplay
Headset is pretty gosh-darn cool
Nice sound effects
It may seem short, but the challange makes the 12 missions very tedious
Nice aresonel of weapons(M-60 all the way, baby!!)
Online mode just makes the game better
Replay value is varied on wether you like stealth or not
This game is one of the best online games I've ever played
Cons:
Very hard
Damn these realistic games(you die after 3-5 shots)
Some missions ... me off, like the one where you had to save a man and his wife
Boomer and Specture alwats end up dyin some way(Well Bommer at least)
If you get wacked with a rifle by the enemy once, you're wacked(Now come on does that really kill people)
I thought nothing would stand up to Tom Clancy games, but this one blows them out of the water, and even Ghost Recon couldn't rock this powerhouse of a game(Altho Ghost recon is a good game, and the fact that it's one of Xbox's best online games.  It's a shame PS2 and Gamecube didn't have their's online).  Trust me I was never a big fan of stealth games(But MGS2 was an exception), but this one had tons of fun, then all of a sudden, I got Tenchu and Splinter Cell, enjoying stealth games all of a sudden.  If you love stealth games, or if you loved games by Tom Clancy, this will knock you out of your shoes, and you don't have to go online, cause one player is enough to keep you satisfied, but if you have a modem, you can kill people, and they won't even know who you are.

Pros:
- Tracks are interesting.
- Moderately refreshing to be able to drive cars in an unconventional way.

Cons:
- The AI for the cars latches onto you too tightly. Even if you are driving slowly they never get very far ahead and even when you enter Zone mode and blaze past everyone, invariably somebody is always just behind you. So clearly the AI is cheating.
- No weapons. You can only shunt and flip your car.

"It was 1989. Konami has released a highly popular arcade game called Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, which is based off of the also popular comic and television series of the same name. In the same year, Konami also made a TMNT game for the NES. It was rather a platformer instead of a port of the arcade game. A year later, the arcade game was ported to the NES as TMNT II: The Arcade Game. Now, here's TMNT III, released in 1992. Is it as good as the arcade game?

Yes, it is. The graphics are even better, the sounds are great, the music still rocks, and the gameplay is pure beat 'em up goodness. If you loved the arcade game, then you will totally enjoy smashing through ninjas in this game's levels. In face, there are some cool new moves you can perform. You can also just flat-out pick up the enemy with your weapon and throw him behind you!

The action is also tighter than in the arcade game. Unfortunately, the life bar isn't as big as the previous game (NES version), but at least you can still plow through the enemies easily. I find myself using the pick-up-enemy-with-weapon move very often. It kills the enemy within 1 hit, while it takes 4 hits to kill with normal attacks.

Overall, this is a very fun game. I recommend you to buy this, especially if you and your friend love the Ninja Turtles.",5.0,B00004SVVJ,TMNT dominates again,Video Games

"I usually prefer to read or play outside to video games, so I put off getting a PS3 because I knew i would get addicted and waste too much time.  I saw that RE5 was coming out and thought ""If one thing was to convince me to get a PS3...""  Well, i finally decided to bite the bullet and purchased a PS3 and RE5, and I have not been disappointed.  All in all, it isn't as good as RE4 (I could go into detail as to why,  but lets just leave it at that) but obviously the graphics are better and some of the other differences are better as well.  ok, i'm starting to ramble...

Chris & Sheva - it was weird at first having some AI person following you around and yelling every 5 seconds ""OK!!!"", but once i got used to it, i really enjoyed that aspect of the game.

no ""run and gun"" - one of the biggest complaints by most people. sometimes it sucks, but you get used to it, and after playing Dead Space and Uncharted (which are almost as good) - I have come to garner respect for the increased difficulty with this aspect...I also enjoy the increased accuracy that comes with this, when you are fighting Zombies, headshots are key!

What really makes this game so great is its depth. Uncharted is great, but there's not a whole lot to it, you just follow the story, jump around like a monkey and shoot a lot of people. In RE5, every single opponent has a different optimal strategy (type of weapon, place to shoot them, etc) to beat, I like puzzles, some people don't but having a boss where you just shoot him a bunch of times isn't much fun for me, having a boss where you have to devise a strategy, shoot him in one place, then switch weapons to shoot him in his true vulnerability, thats where its at!

Anyway, great game, the Gold standard I hold every other game to.  Dead Space was pretty close. Uncharted 1 was not too bad. Resistance 2 was pretty boring for me.  I'm looking forward to the new DLCs coming out next month and Dead Space 2, hopefully I can find a few others that are similar to this, though I know none will be able to surpass.",5.0,B0012N94WO,The reason I bought a PS3,Video Games

"Buyer definitely be warned... as is the case with many other next-gen games that have been transferred to past-gen (such as LOTR: Shadow of Mordor), unfortunately, the touted graphics and high frame-rate are mostly absent, as many professional reviews which commend these factors often only refer to the next-gen versions. This game is riddled with bugs, frame-rate dips, lag, and nearly every cut scene in the game has delayed texture pop-in. Also, LITERALLY every cutscene has audio-sync issues; no cutscene as of yet has had the characters' dialogue audio match the physical mouth movements; this issue is absolutely pervasive, so much so that I've given up expecting textures, graphics, and audio to function normally at all in the game's cutscenes, which there are many (since the game is heavily story-driven, the interactive cutscenes are a key factor and take up much of the gametime).

Luckily, amidst occasional glitches, the game's core gameplay mechanics still seem to function okay, though many other reviewers, both here on Amazon and elsewhere, are claiming their copy doesn't even do THAT well enough, and even has persistent crashing at certain points in the game, and I thoroughly believe it, so buying the PS3 or 360 version may be a gamble.

"This game is unparallel in its ability to be amazing. One of the best games... EVER!!

This game takes place 6 years after the Mansion accident in the first game. You play as the famous Leon Kennedy from Resident Evil 2. He is now working as an agent for the CIA, and the president's daughter gets kidnapped. His mission is to go on a solo mission to try to receive her, all why trying to discover why a small, quiet town is suddenly in an uproar; enraged, and on a killing spree, they all seem to be after you... the question is why.

***THIS REVIEW FEATURES NO MAJOR SPOILERS ABOUT THE GAME, ENDING, OR ANYTHING THAT WOULD STOP YOU FROM PLAYING IT***

Gameplay - (10/10) - I am usually a very critical game, so for me to not have any complaints in a game is near impossible. This on the other hand, features none, except one. The frame rate is perfect, the controls are great, but there is slowdown in some of the CGI. I didn't take off points for it, but it is there. Ragdoll physics are put to great use in this game, and some minor tweaks have been made to the already great Resident Evil series. The most noticeable is the elimation of set camera angles, over the shoulder camera, the ability to aim (so realistic that his arm actually struggles to keep steady), and the ability to save without having ribbons. You also get a larger inventory, and can collect money to buy weapons from vendors. The game is so much longer than other Resident Evil games, that the second disc actually seems not surprising at all. The game runs about 25 hours, I beat it in 21:43 my first time through (got it shipped early :). This whole gaming experience is just great. When an enemy tries to grab on to you, trying to bite your neck or eat your brains you can kick them off, or kick their head (if they are weak enough, they experience a very awesome head explosion death). You can also kill innocent cows and chickens and such (monks later). This game requires you to observe a little more, for instance, you can shoot down a chandileer that is lit, and incinerate all of the enemies below. You can ride in a boat, run from giant rocks, and many many more. The story also gets very immersive later in the story, but I'll stop at that so that I don't slip any spoilers out.

Graphics - (10/10) - I don't know if you've seen the game lately, but the graphics are amazing. Bordering the graphics of some PC games, and featuring better ragdoll physics than some as well, the game runs as smooth as it looks. Models, enviornments, and atmosphere are all very detailed and believable. Blood looks a little fake, but the there is enough that it doesn't matter. The game is a lot more polished than the demo, smoothing out some of the jaggies, and making the game look just unbelievably amazing. This games graphics are some of the best seen anywhere, and will still be great 5-10 years from now, even when compared to FMV sequences.

Sound - (10/10) - Each weapon sounds as intense as it should, cows moo, chickens cluck, all is good. The creepy groanings and intense musical score as the mindless people attempt to eat you alive really heighten the game as a whole. Every sound is rendered great in this game, from the water ripples to the footsteps, to the dog squeels, and the sawing clunking bodies of those captured by the possessed people hitting wooden posts or getting burned. The sound in this game is one of the key factors, and the bonus soundtrack with songs from both Resident Evil movie soundtracks are pretty cool as well.

Value - (9/10) - The most value out of any offline Resident Evil game. This game is one that you will definately want to go through more than once. You can get things you didn't see or missed, get better weapons, and try it on hard mode. There are a lot of unlockables, which I will not name because I count them as spoilers, but lets just say it well worth it. Mulitplayer would have been cool, as well as a Co-Op mode, but I think the game is fine the way it is, with or without multiplayer capabilties.

This is not just a game for fans. Fans will love the story, the possessed people, and the adventure, where non fans will love how the game is much quicker paced, much more fun, has more weapons, easier to control, and just a great shooter in general.

The worlds are very detailed and the music in some of the levels are really good like Lava Reef and Death Egg Zone to name 2 of my favorites. The game is designed very similar to Sonic 3 with a sub-boss in the middle followed by the mustache maniac Robotnick. The fact that you can lock it onto sonic 3 makes it that much more enjoyable and makes sonic 3 that much longer.

"Growing up one of my favorite toys were legos as you could create anything you imagined. There have been a series of video games based off of serious movie and comic franchises. From Indiana Jones to Star Wars there have been a lego video game based off of it. Now Tell Tale games have unleashed their latest game called Lego Marvel Super Heroes but is this a game you will want to play?

The game centers on the villains that have banded together to free their brethren from secured facilities. From Rykers Island to the Raft six groups have been formed and each of them are in charge of all the lackeys underneath them. The six teams are led by such iconic villains such as Ultron & Loki , Dr. Doom, Tinkerer, Dormammu & Baron Mordo, Magneto & Mystique and Enchantress, Executioner, and the Mandarian. They have banded together to build a Doom Ray of Doom to unleash against the world. Nick Fury decides that he is going to need some help on this one as he summons the worlds greatest heroes to help him capture these bad guys.

And the roster of heroes that you will be able to play as is just as immense. Thor, Wolverine, Spiderman and Deadpool are just a sampling of the great characters you can play as. Each of the missions allows you to choose between two heroes and go against hordes of a common enemy. For example the first mission that takes place in New York has two heroes (Spiderman and Nova) going after the Sinister Six. And the bosses of course reflect this as you will be going up against Doctor Octopus , Electro and others.

One of the unique features of this game are the comic missions that you can undergo. Some of the more iconic missions are going after your uncles killer as Spiderman. Or you can head over to Japan as Wolverine to battle the Silver Samurai. These comic missions are a nice touch to the game as you can relive some of your favorite memories in Marvel history.

"The Xbox One version of this game is about what you would expect: Awesome.

Are the graphics noticeably better with breathtaking hi-res textures and more complex polygons and animations? Ha! But that's not what Minecraft is about.

There's no real story or campaign or objectives in Minecraft. You simply start out, have a variety of tools and environments to explore/destroy/build upon, and do whatever you want from there.

Complexity ranges from ultra simple (TNT go boom lolz!), to as horrendously complex as you want to make it (wiring switches to do all kinds of crazy things, create meta-games, and so forth).

There's the standard mode where you have a life bar, more limited resources (which forces you to craft/farm/mine for resources), and enemies. Or creative mode which is more suited for purely creating awesome stuff faster and easier. You can fly, move super fast, have unlimited materials, and so forth. Creative mode will prove to be a much easier way to build that replica Death Star you've been wanting for so long.

The console versions of Minecraft are always a little bit behind the PC version in terms of updates, but most won't notice or care except the die-hard Minecrafters. I prefer the console version simply because I prefer my couch to my office chair.

One important thing to note is that if you bought the Xbox 360 version previously (digital), you can purchase the Xbox One (digital) version from the Xbox Store for a discounted $4.99, which was totally worth it in my opinion. The Xbox One version also has many new achievements compared with the 360 version (1000 points worth vs 200 points). You may not care about these, but I personally love trying to fully explore the games and unlock all their achievements, so this adds a *lot* of replay value for me. Some of them will take quite some time to attain as they can't be unlocked in Creative mode.

But digital discounts aside, I generally prefer disc versions of games. Physical games tend to go on better sales and more frequent sales, they help me expand my fairly expansive physical game library, I don't have to worry as much about disk space, I can lend the game to a friend or resell it, and I have the pleasant feeling of actually owning something tangible. But if these perks don't interest you, the convenience of digital is nice to have to (switch games without swapping discs).

It might take awhile of tinkering around with the game before you ""get it"", but once you do, it can be a lot of fun.",5.0,B00NMO0IA8,"Everything is awesome! Oops, wrong franchise.",Video Games

"Ducktales is one of the very few games that prove that even the shortest game can succeed. There's only 5 levels, and you repeat 1, but those 5 levels are lengthy.

The plot is that Scrooge McDuck, the richest duck in the world, wants to be even richer by traveling around the world, finding treasures.

You can go to Transylvania, the Amazon, the Moon, the Himalayas, and the African Mines.

Ducktales shares certain similarities to MegaMan, like the level selection, how the levels scroll when you fall, and how there's a boss at the end of every level. In fact, Capcom made this game.

"For starters, I read some of the other reviews on this game and some people out there really need glasses. This game looks excelent! Much better than ANYTHING a developer could have ever accomplished on the original XBox.

As far as the difficulty in building a good mech goes, it has nothing to do with spending time to get ""better parts"", it is all about learning how to build a better mech. You really need to spend time finding out what kind of mech works for you. That does indeed take some time and effort, but all the parts to build a decent mech are all right there. Sure, there are some advanced parts that you can aquire through the Marketplace, playing through the storyline, or bidding on in the auction, but they aren't anything spectacular. This game is not for people who want to plop in a game disk, find the rocket launcher, and get 30 kills.

I really enjoy this game, it isn't as fast paced as the MechAssault games are, but the customization is so much fun. Anyone willing to spend the time  to tweak their mech just right to fit them is going to have lots of fun with this game. I personally love my little hovercraft mech with 4 pile weapons and a machine gun on it. It is fast, maneuverable, and can eliminate almost any mech with just two hits. Throw an NA jammer on it during multiplayer games and come up behind the commander mech and take him out before he even knows you're there.

This game is really fun, with amazing graphics, but it does take some time to get into and isn't for those who like to jump right in and expect to be good at it right away.",5.0,B000F1YGMM,What MechAssault 2 Should have Been,Video Games

"It's hard to believe this was a launch title. This has got more play time than all my other titles combined.

It's almost a perfect port, and unlike its iOS and android cousin, feels and looks close to the original.

Inputs are lag free and gameplay fluid.

The controls work well, moves are easy to pull off.

Other than static backgrounds and occasional slowdown during special moves, graphics remain true to the console versions.

The VS mode is a fun way to practice on the go.

Other than animated backdrops, this version lacks:-
- Recently added characters such as  Evil Ryu, Rolento, Hugo etc.
- The hardest setting is easier than the console versions.

"when I first got this game and started playing it I thought this game was going to be cool, the graphics are awsome, the characters are cool,the story is even cool. what makes this game a let down for me is the combat system and alot of the same enemies throughout the long and boring areas. To me this game plays like FF12 except the fact you can combine skills to create combos which you might hardly ever use because of the action blocks you try to save for transforming into the white night. The skill set up would be cool if each character had there own signiture moves, instead each character can learn the same skills as everybody else. There are very few treasure chests to find in the game and half the time there not worth getting because they might hold a lowsy healing herb or some peace of armor or weapon you already have, so don't expect alot of hunting around for riches. Not a whole lot in variety of armor or weopons either,as every character can equip all the same stuff so once again no special outfits for different characters. Oh and the lamest part of the game is the mute avatar you create at the start of the game,useless! There are plenty of sidequests which you can only tackel with your avatar and you really cant do them alone so you team up with people online to make them easier.

"Great tower defense game. It is perfectly priced at 29.99 because tower defense in general are not worth a lot.
This game does have a long single player campaign. You have cities that you have to defend. Each city is shaped like a circle with rings of defense. In each ring there are individual squares where you build each structure. You build structures like gatling guns, sniper guns, missle launchers, power plants, and housing for civilians. The point of civilians is to get taxes out of them to get more money to build more and better structures. You can also upgrade each structure up to at least level 10.
You get to choose which city and which enemies you want to fight to earn money, crytals, and advance in the story. After each level if you win you also get civiilians to move into the city. The better you did the more civilians and crystals which are used for certain structures. There are levels of enemy attacks from 1 on. The lower the easier and it is infinite the amount of times you can beat enemies so you can grind and level up your stuff as much as you want. Also there are bosses after you play a certain amount of enemies in a row. There are also leaders who give you special abilities like reduced cost of structures or superuattacks who you level up as well.
If you like tower defense or strategy I bet you will like this. It is a very deep game  FOR A TOWER DEFENSE GAME. You don't do anything but tower defense so if you don't like that then sure as hell DO NOT BUY THIS.
I did not give it 5 stars because it can get boring and repetitive so it is best in short bursts. Also the story is useless and the commanders for some reason are teenagers and is non sensical. They coulda made it better by making it older and more realistic commanders. Also 30$ is steep for any tower defense game even one as deep and long as this. Maybe it is just cuz I am cheap but 20$ woulda been perfect.

In conclusion,
I HIGHLY RECOMEND buying this game if you like TOWER DEFENSE GAMES. If you like strategy buy it if you can get it for 20$ or less. IF YOU DO NOT LIKE EITHER STRATEGY OR TOWER DEFENSE than NEVER buy this game!",4.0,B017BB8ZCU,Deep and great tower defense game. Only cartidge based one on vita,Video Games

"Bust a move blast is a great game for the wii.  Like all the other bust a moves it plays exactly the same.  In this game you get to select between 8 characters that you can play with.

Characters
Each character has their own special taunts and comments they say when they win or loose.  Characters don't change the way the game plays at all they just add to the hidden content you can unlock such as artwork. (4/5)

Gameplay
The game plays just like any other bust a move. (You shoot colored orbs in a dirrection and connect the same color with others similar to break them and clear the board.)  Something new with this is you can play with up to 8 people with 4 remotes and 4 nunchucks.  This 8 player is a load of fun with a house full of people.  (4/5)

Graphics
Well its a wii game and we know the wii doesnt produce exactly cutting edge graphics.  Anyway reguardless it is very colorful and cartoonish.  The powerups and orbs look very brilliant in color. On a side note the additinal unlocked artwork is a nice bonus. (4/5)

Replayability
There are over 200 levels to play on this game so there is a lot to do to complete it fully.  Also you can replay certain levels you want to do better on.  The game has a way of keeping you coming back every once in awhile to have a little fun.

Controls
This is the big one.  The controls are used with the wii motion.  You move your controller side to side to angle where you shoot your orbs.  This is a great added bonus over traditional controllers because you get an actual feel for where you want the orbs to go.  This also adds human error because if you move the controller or don't have steady hands you can mess up your throws.  (5/5)

"The Conduit is an effective and entertaining FPS for the Wii.  Is that saying much?  Well, yes and no.  Overall, the game is good.  However, when stacked against its PS3, 360, and PC brethren it fails to compare, but that doesn't mean it's not fun.

The plot is your standard alien invasion story/government cover-up.  Nothing new, but it's still intriguing.  The graphics are nice to look at, considering it's the Wii.  However, I really don't think they are that much better than Metroid Prime: Corruption's.  It does have a solid framerate with decent shadows and particle effects.  The controls are similar to Metroid's.  Aim with the Wiimote and move with the nunchuck (pretty precise).  I like how you can throw grenades using the nunchuck, but it takes a little practice (I usually end up throwing them way over the enemies heads).

There is a nice assortment of aliens/enemies.  Environments are a little bland (again, it's the Wii).  Maybe it's me, but sometimes the AI can be brutal.  Enemies come in waves and there's no cover system, so you really have to keep moving.  In that vein, the game really doesn't have much that's innovative.  Even the All Seeing Eye (A.S.E) doesn't do much more for you than expose switches on the walls or explosives on the ground.

The Conduit was the main reason I bought another Wii (I had previously sold my first one because it was collecting dust).  At this point I'm probably enjoying House of the Dead: Overkill more than The Conduit.  It's not that I don't like The Conduit.  I just may have had overly high expectations.  At some level I'm probably comparing it to Killzone 2, Gears 2, and COD4 (which I know I shouldn't do).  As a Wii FPS, it's a definite 4 stars.  In the vast realm of FPS's, it's more like a 3.",4.0,B001HKPUKC,You Con-du-it,Video Games

As some have said, yes the game can be fun for a short period of time but then you'll most likely never get the urge to play it again. Doing some simple tasks in the game proves to be a bigger chore than in other versions and the cities you create feel empty and lifeless. However, if you've got lots of time on your hands and don't mind some of the neater additions of the pc versions missing along with some slowdown when disasters occur, then you will probably enjoy this game.",1.0,B0000CDZBE,Stick with the PC versions...,Video Games

"I have always been a VF fan, but i never thought it could be as good as Tekken.  Now, I gladly trade the entire Tekken series for this one masterpiece of a fighting game.  Those of you who say the gameplay is too simple clearly aren't getting the complete idea of how many fighting moves you can get out of combining those three different buttons.  Those of you who say there aren't enough modes should play more Kumite.  I can understand some hardcore gamers who beat the Kumite mode in a few weeks, but for those of you who haven't gone into that, you really should.  You have to win over a thousand matches to even get a chance to fight Dural, who is the unlockable character. Kumite also brings the most fun aspect i have seen in a fighting game: customizable characters.  Finally, for those of you who want more endings, I have a word of advice for you: go into RPG's.  A fighting game like Tekken 4 that tries to make up for their below par controls with flashy endings,(and i have seen all those Tekken 4 endings for any of you who wonder) will never be as good as a fighter that turns toward the gameplay before they even think about some storyline endings.

"This will probably be the best football/soccer game for the PSP for quite some time; FIFA has always put out great titles and the graphics is really good. Athough the animation is smooth, the problem comes from the slightly sluggish reaction time... while I understand the player physics used to good effect on consoles, it does not do well on the PSP's analog thumbpad making pivots (even more difficult given that touch/finesse moves uses the d-pad which is really hard to switch back and froth from the thumbpad), meeting and avoiding opposing players while keeping the ball difficult even on the semi-pro level.

There are a lot of options, though; from quick friendlies, half seasons, mini-game challenges, custom season and players along with a huge amount of players and teams make the game immediately accessible.

I would give this three and half stars only because it's a fine game, not a breakout one. The controls just do not seem to have been optimized for the PSP... it is worth playing but I wouldn't put this in the same class as Ridge Racer and Wipeout.",3.0,B0007UVXSG,a draw...,Video Games

"I loved the first three Ninja Gaidens on Nintendo Entertainment System. They were challenging, frustrating, but the games were fantastic. It is not surprising then that Tecmo managed to transform their 2D franchise to 3D in an exceptional manner.

This game is a remake of Ninja Gaiden Black from Xbox (thus Sigma, meaning the sum). I never played the Xbox version, but after playing this game for the first few hours, I wondered why I waited so long. The game looks fantastic, running 1080p at 60 FPS (all the graphics have been overhauled). The control feels really tight, and making nimble moves feels natural. The learning curve may be steep for some, but the result is quite worth it. I was not a proficient ninja for the first few chapters of the game, but now that I have somewhat mastered Ryu's moves, I am able to quickly dispatch a group of enemies with grace and ease, with their heads rolling, literally.

The game contains additional playable character Rachel, as well as additional weapons over the Xbox version; dual sword wielding is awesome. You can unlock additional costumes, hair styles, and difficulties.

If you feel competitive, the game allows you to upload your scores to Playstation Network to compare with players around the world. You can see how many times they died, the time it took them to complete the game, and how many ninpos (special moves) were used.

"This game is cheap. Not cheap in the time spent playing it sense or stupid ""I got jipped by this cheap game"" sense, but it is actually cheap money wise. But you didn't really need me to tell you that.

What I can tell you is that this game is awesome. Sure, it's not Halo 2 or Half-Life, but it doesn't claim to be. It offers some really great elements as far as storyline and realism goes. Now, I know what your thinking, if it was so realistic, it wouldn't have zombies because zombies aren't real. That is beside the point. And anyway, don't you buy games because they are fun, not because they remind you of real life. For example, you have to be precise with your shots, and choose when to use them, because ammo is not a plenty in this game.

What this game lacks in flashy graphics, it makes up for in one key area, an area that is important in the original Romero movies, as well as Land of the Dead. Melee weapons. you have a host of different melee weapons to use, each with its own special uses. Such weapons include a hammer, a baseball bat, a golf club, and a shovel. Also, you can pick up a fire axe. If you just had a bad day at work, and take it from me, i have had them, just sit down with this game, pick up a fire axe, and imagine that the zombie horde is really your boss.

"I've been playing NBA 2K since the original release for the Sega Dreamcast. I don't return video games often, but I had to return 2K15.

From there you can launch back into MyPlayer mode, which will take you right back to the start of the game folks. It doesn't save your game progress!

"I've got to state up front that I suffer from major Star Wars burnout -- the first movie (1977) was great, everything else has been merchandising -- so my praise for this game is not given lightly.

Gameplay is smooth and dynamic, some Star Wars games we've had in the past have been really dreadfully behind the times, this feels like it's state-of-the-art.

The space combat is a welcome addition. My son clued me in on new characters previously not available to be played. It looks great on the screen.

Overall? For a Star Wars game, very good. For any other game, ok. It's an improvement on previous Star Wars games, but for my money I just do not want to hear Obi Wan Kenobi's voice encouraging me to trust the force or take a droidica apart or anything like that. I'm just sick of Star Wars in general.

Now, my son, who's eleven, thinks this is the best game he's played since Halo 2. So go forth and figure.",4.0,B0009O7HVM,Very good for a Star Wars game,Video Games

The car handling is horrific, I have no idea who designed the car physics but they did a horrible job and given that a lot of missions either have you chasing or being chased this really ruins the game.

As for the hacking, the trailers and descriptions made it sound like you would be able to hack almost anything and anyone.  This is absolutely not the case.

It feels like a GTA wannabe with hacking shoe-horned into the game.

"I am playing the PC version of this game on a very high end PC @ 5760x1080 and I have to say it's the most fun gaming I have had in a long time.. the wide open world (well, it's really only the fictional island of Panau, but it feels HUGE) is a blast to run around in.. drive your boat over the best looking rendered water I have seen in a game (with CUDA water fx enabled) or take to the sky in a plane or chopper... run the missions and follow the story or just run around in the ""sand box"" and mess with things, do wild stunts and anything that comes to mind... it's got all car stealing the fun of GTA with the battle action of maybe Far Cry mixed with some Quake II Lithium mod also.. the grapple reminds me so much of the hook in Quake II Lithium.  The natural extremely open environment feels a little like a modern Oblivion on steroids.  anyways.. this game is a blast.. it's also fairly intense for a PC, so be ready to have a good graphics card, a GF100 would be ideal (GTX480, 470, or 460... or two of them in SLI).

Well, I'm just rambling now.. but this game is a ton o fun.  If you're not convinced just go to you tube and search for Just Cause 2 and watch all the videos people have made.",5.0,B0013RC1W4,wide open gorgeous world to romp in!,Video Games

"I have never played any games in the SC series, which I think might be part of my problem.  If you have some familiarity with the series (I had read that some missions in this game were taken directly from the console versions), then you probably have some idea of what is going on.  I found myself struggling with the awkward character movement and unclear objectives.  Also, (and this might be my fault for not reading the instructions) I could not save in the middle of a level and return to that point later.  When I saved and turned the game off, it always started me at the beginning of the level instead of where I left off.

I found the game controls to be very clumsy, particularly when trying to manuever Sam near the edge of a cliff or dropoff.  It is really easy to send him falling.

As some other reviewers had pointed out, the settings in this game are very dark.  You will need to use the night vision goggles most of the time, which gets annoying.

I played Syphon Filter before this one and found that game to be much betterr.  If you are looking for a shooter, I would stay away from Splinter Cell and go with something else.  If you're a Splinter Cell fan, you might enjoy this game, if you can get past the annoyances.",2.0,B000E0L424,Very disappointing game,Video Games
"Retiree here.  After reaching pro level on Wii golf, I wanted to play a different golf game. The same course (Wii golf) is too repetitive.  I agree with the other 2 reviews posted to date. Just purchased it, have played for 2 hours, and will update this ASAP.  It's a fun game with very good graphics.  I have not read the directions yet, (like to jump in and play first), and found swinging confusing until I realized how it works.  You lift your club until the blue line on the power bar, equals the distance you need to drive. Totally different than Wii golf, and should not be confused with a real golf match game.  However, there is enough golf, and interesting scenery, to satisfy my desire for a second game. This game is a sleeper, and will get much more playing time than some other titles I have reviewed.

While Miis are not used, the characters are a definite plus. They are lifelike humans, rather than cartoonish. When you have some winnings, you take your character to the clubhouse, and dress them as you like. The costumes range from conservative to highly suggestive.  I wasn't able to purchase the new clothing, but I was able to change my character into the different outfits.  Initially, you only have a choice of 2 characters. I am using Hanah, a cute and personable girl of about 20. She has a cute voice. Based on my initial 3 hole practice round (done 4 times until my first birdie), I expect to put quite a few hours on this game.

This is my update.  I have now read the directions.  Marginal help.  Then I went through the tutorial again.  I was making a lot of mistakes.  You need to go through the tutorial a second time.  It means more after you have played. You can change the direction of your putts and drives, just like Wii golf.  The special shots are fun. I just finished 3 more hours of play.  The game is addictive, once you understand it. You have to like humor. I like Rayman Rabbits.  I think 8 years and up is an appropriate age level. Girls 8+ will especially like the different costumes and accessories available.  Boys will just like the game play. It's also great for adults.  I'm a retiree.  The key is to go through the tutorial several times. Once before you play. then at least once after you have played for 1-2 hours. I was initially frustrated before I went back to the tutorial.  I think this is a great game and will be playing it quite a bit.",5.0,B000WWNRJM,A golf game that makes you laugh. Not for serious golfers.,Video Games

"When I purchased this game way back in June, I wondered if it was going to be a worthy sucessor to the great Sonic Adventure. Then I played it. My first reaction?...[WOW]!!! Then after playing it for a while(read: about 2 minutes), every doubt in my mind was gone.
The first thing you notice after it boots up is just how gorgeous it is. This title is just as good, or better, than any game on the PS2(Gran Turismo 3 wasn't out yet). The game flows at a steady 60 frames-per-second, and rarely drops below. And remember how blocky and jerky Sonic and friends were in the first game? No more. The characters have been re-tooled to where they look almost completely round(except around the eyes and gloves where you can really see the poly's, but who cares?) and move more realistically then ever before.
On the character front, there are some changes. First off, Big and E-102 are gone(although Big has several cameos, but he's pretty hard to find). In their place are two all new characters. Shadow(Sonics' rival) and Rouge(Knuckles' rival). Shadow is almost just like Sonic, except his colors are black and red, and he wears special hover-shoes, so he never actually touches the ground. Rouge is a white bat(who is of the female gender I might add) who, at the same time as Knuckles, is trying to find the pieces of the master emerald for her boss, Eggman.
Gameplay-wise, this game really excels...and falls behind. On one hand, Sonic and Shadows levels are quote:""Way past cool!""(sorry), and Tails no longer races Sonic. His game is now a lot like E-102's, except it is more fun. Also, you can actually play as Eggman! His game is just like Tails', but in different levels and on the dark side of the story. Plus...the overworld is gone! You now go straight to the next level(after a cut-scene, though), just like the good ol' Sonic games. But on the other hand, the 'search and gather' levels of the first game are back. That alone isn't the bad part. The bad part is, they're twice as hard, twice as large, and twice as boring. It wouldn't be so bad, but you now must find the emerald pieces in a certain order, so in the later levels, they take about 20 minutes to complete. No joke. Plus, you MUST complete them to advance.
Another bad part is the camera. In the first game, if the camera was stuck, you could press the D-pad for a close-up, and then reset it. But now, except for being able to rotate it, the camera is now up to the computer. This causes you to play some of the levels many times.
There is also a two-player mode, which was absent from the first go-around. And while it is not very deep, it does add some replay value.
Overall, this is an excellent successor to the earlier Sonic games, and is a great addition to your Dreamcast library. The fact that it is Sonic, alone, should make you buy it. But if you're not a Sonic freak, this game will make you one. Get it.",5.0,B000059Z7G,The hedgehog shows no sign of slowing down,Video Games
"State of Decay is such a great game that I'm almost at a loss for words trying to come up with proper and adequate praise for it. Even if this updated and improved version of the original Xbox 360 game is still a little rough around the edges, the game itself more than makes up for any shortcomings with some truly immersive and addicting gameplay.

Due to the game's open ended sandbox nature, you can expect to find yourself in many different situations that don't play out anywhere near how you thought they would, that is, if you even saw them coming in the first place. The game does a great job of conveying the mood and atmosphere of a zombie apocalypse scenario. There's a weighty, oppressive feel to the game mainly due to the general nature of the game and how it's meant to be played. Going out for food and supplies isn't an option here, it's a necessity and one that will turn around and bite you in the backside if you're not being mindful of such things. As you play and build your characters up, you'll inevitably start getting attached to them, which only sets the stage for you to be utterly devastated if and when you lose one of them. It's a pretty easy thing to have happen as it's very easy for your characters to get overwhelmed in this game due to several key factors: limited inventory space, stamina and the game's unpredictable world. Go in gung-ho and more often than not, you can expect to pay the ultimate price of a grisly death. Many times I found myself dying because I thought I was the man, so to speak. I'd throw myself into a horde of zombies, just to tire myself out from swinging my weapon incessantly and getting overrun while trying to run for it.

I've made much of the game's unpredictable events and I think it's here that the game truly shines. Yesterday I was playing and I had to go from one corner of the map to the other to retrieve a memento for one of the characters. Easy as pie, I thought. I took a pick up truck from my home base and set out across the game's sprawling map, weaving in and out of junked cars and running down dozens of zombies with impunity. I spotted a destroyed bridge ahead that could be jumped with a vehicle if I pulled it off perfectly.... which of course, I didn't. The truck flipped, tossing me out of the side window and then exploded a few moments later from being upside down on the ground. Now the situation had changed; I was out in the middle of the woods with only a couple of painkillers and an energy drink to keep me alive. I'd purposely taken only a reload's worth of rounds for my rifle from the base supply locker so I'd have to be careful making my way to my goal, a ranger station a few hundred feet away. To make a long story short, it took me over an hour and a half just to get back to my home base and everything that happened to me during that space of time was harrowing and intense, worthy of a detailed, written story. The best thing is, the game is full of moments like this and pulls the carpet out from under you whenever it can to make sure that nearly every encounter with the Zeds is a unique and memorable one

Now, that's not to say that the game is perfect, especially from a technical standpoint. It has its fair shares of shoddy glitches and half baked elements that give the impression that the game is almost incomplete at times. It's a huge improvement over the Xbox 360 version but still, you get a fair amount of clipping and pop-up at times, which really shouldn't be a factor in this generation of console games. A lack of variety in voice over actors is noticeable and the AI on the NPC's can get a little funky at times but for the most part everything operates at a serviceable rate and you'll be fine more often than not. I could also comment on the game's lack of a multiplayer component but since Undead Labs are bringing that into their next game, I really don't mind the absence of it.

I can go on and on about how much I absolutely adore State of Decay but I'd rather just end it all by saying that if you allow yourself to be taken in by this game and keep yourself from getting frustrated by the game's glitches and bugs, you'll have an absolute blast with it. With the inclusion of the two DLC expansions included from the Xbox 360 version as well, you'll have plenty to keep you busy for weeks to come. State of Decay is a love letter to fans of the genre and it shows when you notice the little touches. One can't help but smile when the new house your survivors have taken over is listed as the ""Savini Residence"".

"More of an attempt to create a Leisure Suit Larry Xtreme Party Games title, rather then a continuance of the classic adventure series, Leisure Suit Larry: Magna Cum Laude will disappoint a majority of it's long time fans. Instead of talking to women, working out puzzles and trying to persuade them to spend some quality time with you, here you have a number of arcade games to complete to pass the game. It's the most laziest game design I'd ever seen, my heart sank when a majority of the puzzles required you to play Pong or take photos. The comedy in the game is okay, but it does wear out its welcome when most of the jokes rely on swearing and the fact they've all been done before to better effect in previous titles. Leisure Suit Larry: Magna Cum Laude also has little reply value compared to its predecessors. A game like Larry 7: Love For Sail had heaps of secrets programmed into it that kept the gamers busy for months playing with shortcut keys and program files. In MCL, all you have to do after you finish is keep playing annoying arcade games until you can afford to make everyone nude.

There's almost nothing here for the long time fans except slight nudity and a few cheap references to the previous titles. Although it should be noted, Sierra tried to win the old time fans over by saying the series creator, Al Lowe, would participate in the creation of this title as a creative consultant. However, months went by with Lowe not receiving any word from the developers. People had grown impatient and evidently gave up hope on Sierra making an effort to contact Larry's creator. However, just before the release of the game, Lowe recieved an e-mail from the developers. It turned out the only involvement they intended for Al Lowe was to make him sign a waver that wouldn't allow him to criticise the game when it came out. Lowe humbly refused their offer.

If you want a game that shares the Larry series traits, look over eBay for Freddy Pharkas, Frontier Pharmacist.

If you're just after a little computer nudity, can't you find cheap Hentai instead?

The gameplay, as always, was amazing as well.  Unfortunately there were too many times you were forced to use the batmobile and it got boring pretty quickly.
The story felt forced and was not as creative as previous iterations.  I guess that's to be expected as they had already used all of the best villains.  I think the biggest tell for me was that when I finished the game (100% - riddler trophies) I had no desire to start a new game + because of the repetitive nature of the soldier battles, the tank mode fights- especially the ridiculous tank bosses, and the often cumbersome riddler trophies.

"Graphics - 9/10

I read some reviews stating the graphics were bad. Perhaps the PC version has far superior graphics? All I know is I spent a lot of time in between the fighting just looking around at the fantastic blend of realism and fantasy environments. Trudging along snow-covered mountain passes, looking down to see thousands of Orcs miles below all carrying torches...beautiful! Cautiously, quietly moving through a dark, creepy wood with spider webs all about. These and many other beautifully rendered environments were a joy to behold.

Character models are also done very well. It is nice to play a game where not every dwarf looks exactly the same as every other dwarf (and the same goes for all the ""races""). Those characters included here which we met in the films are also rendered quite well.

Mechanics/Inferface - 6/10

I have played many CRPGs over the years...Baldur's Gate, Neverwinter Nights, Fallout, Elder Scrolls series, etc.. This game fits snugly into the Action RPG category. It does not have extraordinary depth in character customization, but what it has is adequate. Upon leveling you add to attributes and select skills from three skill trees for each character. This brings up a negative that I have learned to live with but wish it had been handled differently. You start the game as either a human male Ranger, an elven female mage, or a dwarven male fighter. At waypoints throughout the game you have the opportunity to switch to one of the other two or remain with the same character. Inhabiting one of the characters is the only time you can change their weapons, armor, or other gear, and add to their stats/skills. I would have liked a bar on the screen letting me know how close to one of these waypoints I was. The positive side of this gameplay is that those of us who tend to stick to one character type (mage, thief, or fighter) in most RPGs are encouraged to try out other styles of play. The interface is somewhat simple as this game is a console port, but everything works fine. Just don't expect a dozen spells and other things mapped to numerous keys.

Story - 9/10

I really enjoyed being part of the conflict depicted in the LotR yet not playing a rehash of the characters/plot of the books and movies. In WitN, you are a significant factor in helping the characters from the books/movies succeed, but you have your own adventures separate from those of Frodo. I felt the way the stories intertwined, and the way the characters interacted, was done very intelligently.

Gameplay - 7/10

My favorite type of game is the deep, open world, story driven RPG with lots of dialog (Baldur's Gate, Morrowind, and more recently Dragon Age and Mass Effect). Fighting is fun but can get repetitious in some games...as it does here. I played this game on Normal difficulty, and since I am not the greatest with real time button mashing, it is quite challenging. Fortunately, you have two computer controlled helpers (or co-op friends) which take some of the pressure off you in fights.

General Comments

I enjoyed this game far more than I expected to. The art style of the environments and the intertwining of the actual events and characters from LotR with your own unique adventure were big positives, overcoming the somewhat repetitious fighting and minimal character customization typical of the Action RPG genre.

Highly recommended.",4.0,B003DNLDR0,Better than I expected,Video Games

"UPDATE:
I received a new console from Nintendo 1 week after I sent it. I have had it for 3 months and everything works perfectly. In fact, I am writing this on it.

The Wii U is a great console. The setup was nice and easy. I actually managed to get the last one in all of the Gamestops in my area.

I turned on the console, and went quickly through the setup process. Then came the long day one update. It lasted me 1 1/2 hours, but it wasn't that bad. The update finished , and I got on the main menu.

The menu is easy to navigate on the Gamepad, and just awesome looking on the TV. I started by running the mini-updates on all of the apps, which each one took about two minutes. Then, I went and tried out every app. Loading times aren't terrific, but it isn't really a big problem. Nintendo announced that they are going to release an update to quicken up loading times.

The console has great graphics. I used it for streaming Amazon Instant Video, and it streamed in HD with no problem and no lag. The Gamepad also had great graphics. It is also very light and comfortable to hold.

The console worked amazingly until the fourth day. Then, I started getting the blinking red light of death. I tried resetting the adapter many times, but with no luck. Once, it got working, but it froze five minutes into gameplay, and wouldn't turn on again. I called Nintendo customer support, and they told me my console needs to be fixed, so I shipped it out, and am still waiting to get it back. Their customer service is great though. They picked up within a minute, and they gave me $10 eshop credit for having this trouble. But if you are worrying if your console won't work, THIS IS NOT A COMMON PROBLEM.

Overall, I was very impressed with this console while it worked. I would highly reccomend getting this console. It is great for single player and multiplayer use.

"I had no problems downloading Sims 3 World Adventures and no problems installing it. This expansion is fun, you get 1000 Sim points for free when you register it through the sims store. You can travel to 3 different countries. China, France and Egypt. Each country has it's own world, tombs, recipes, books, etc. In China, from what I heard, you can train to do Martial Arts and try and kick some mummy's rear end. You can take up photography, martial arts or nectar making, There are a lot of various clothes, hair styles and a lot of furniture and such with this game. You start out with being able to travel for 3 days and have little side quest opportunities to do in each country, you can edit the town of each place even when you are in a regular town/world. This one is pretty awesome, I think and I really like the fact that Amazon has these games to download.as it makes things prety easy and smooth and really quick to download and install.

"I've been playing Civilization all the way from the beginning. The fourth installment has incredible detail, wonderful graphics, lots to do, and a great replay value. With the addition of religion, leader traits, and a whole new technology tree, Civilization 4 is my absolute favorite next to Simcity 4000. Religion needs some polishing because it seems to be non-important later in the game and seems like its not even there. The only bug is the fact that a archer sometimes can defeat a gunpowder unit which is odd. It reminds me of the Phalanx unit in the previous Civilization where it somehow holds out against a tank.

Basically you are in charge of a civilization (there are many to choose from) and you lead them from the stone age to the space age. You have to create cities, spend your gold pieces wisely on research and happiness, and possibly building projects. These projects outside of buildings such as granaries and barracks are called World of Wonder or a Natonial Wonder. There are loads of wonders between the 2 of them so be careful, you only can build a certain amount of each within each of your cities.  The addition of Great Leaders adds a value to the game that sometimes in other games waters it down and gives you an idea as to who will win. This is not the case. For instance, the Great General can bind your units together and give them expierence points where you can upgrade them. These upgrades can be: strength, extra defense, healing, extra strike, and many others. A Great Artist can give any of your cities a culture boost or give a city a ""shot in the arm,"" which means you can get extra prodiction and/or culture.

With the addidtion of 2 expansions this game went from outstanding to amazing just like that. Some minor bugs have been fixed with the exception of early units defeating more advanced units as I stated above. Anyone complaining about it not being polished and horrible are dead wrong. When this game was released it was incredibly strong and hardly buggy. It's a lot better than most games that are released! I preordered it and recieved it when it was released. I was able to get the box that contained the tech tree and extras that included a Sid Meier interview. Not bad but if you get this edition or the one with no extras, there is no difference in price and its not jaw dropping material.

Playing it immediatly, I was astonished and very satisfied. Yes I am guilty of the ""just one more turn"" thinking. This is an absolute for empire-building fans, people who like to explore, war, diplomacy, work the land and recources, and strategy fans.",5.0,B000BC38K6,Terrific Game,Video Games

"I really do enjoy Rock Band 4, however, this game was rushed out the door unfinished.  Which shipping delays and adapter issues, plus promises that still haven't been met, I cannot give this game a perfect score.

The game itself is fun.  And once you tinker with everything, it does work.  However, we were supposed to have access to all our previous dlc.  This is not true.  I have access to about 80% which a lot of tracks still buggy or unable to download for whatever reason on the store.

We were also supposed to have access to our previous Rock Band 1, 2 and 3 library along with the other games.  You still cannot access those songs.  They did however let you download your Green Day tracks if you had the license for it.

No surround sound support.  This really aggravates anyone who is an audiophile.  We had the option in previous games but not this one.  It doesn't make any sense.  They did state they were going to patch it in sometime in November.  Again another unfinished feature.

"I wonder about the people who gave this game four stars.  They compare it to Halo and other FPS's as if it's inferior to them in some way.  They probably said the same about Halo when it first came out.  ""It's alright, but it's no Perfect Dark/Goldeneye.""  In two months they'll be on the bandwagon singing Bioshock praises.  This game is groundbreaking, and don't let the nay-sayers dissuade you.

Originality.  We're getting Halo 3 this month.  I'm as excited as the next guy, with the Legendary Edition and Limited Edition on pre-order (the Legendary version is staying in the wrap).  But it's Halo 3.  I've seen it before.  Call of Duty: Modern Warfare.  I can't stand the linearity of the CoD series.  I consider the games very uninspired.  Bioshock.  Enter a world that is unlike anything you've ever seen.  Massive levels that you can't stop exploring because you have to see what's in the next room.  The environments never get repetitive, which was one of my biggest concerns entering the game.  Each level has a unique personality that you will remember long after playing through.  The game is haunting with it's utopia-gone-wrong feel.  You know this place was awesome once, and then something went horribly wrong.

I'm not going to spoil any of the story for you.  This game is best played fresh, with no idea what's going on.  Anyone who says it's predictable or boring is full of $#!T.  It's one of the best stories I've seen in a game in the past few years.  And how you play through it will definately have an effect in the end.  The good ending even got me a little teary-eyed.

There is a review that complains about the lack of variety in enemies, saying there are only two types.  These two types are more like categories.  Big Daddies and Splicers.  Splicers are the screwed up citizens of Rapture (who have been doing a lot of bad things) and have modified themselves in different ways.  Spider Splicers, Houdini Splicers, Leadhead Splicers, etc.  They all fight in different ways and require different ways of dealing with.  There are only two types of Big Daddies, but fighting them is something you'll remember for a long time.  They are completely docile until you mess with them.  Then their eyes go red and you feel a nice little poo in your pants as the thing comes raging at you.  It's awesome.  Finding more efficient ways of killing them is even better.

Another complaint is that this game lacks multi-player.  It's true, but who cares.  Resident Evil would suck if it were online and so would this.  Not every game needs (or should have) a multi-player component.

Summing up, picking up this game is a no-brainer.  If you hate the idea of no multiplayer, at least rent it.  You can play through it in 15-20 hours, but I took the time to enjoy it and put about 30 hours in on the first playthrough.  Now I'm playing through it again.  I've got to beat it on the hardest difficulty and see what happens when I kill all the little sisters.  Gotta get back to it.",5.0,B000MKA60W,You don't want to miss this.,Video Games

"This review is for those who need to decide on getting Dante's Inferno for the PSP or for the home consoles (PS3/Xbox360). Quick conclusion: get the console version if you can, it's much better and complete. If you want to know more keep reading.

I have played both versions of Dante's Inferno for the home consoles (Xbox 360 in my case) and PSP, and the PSP version is definitively a VERY watered down version, it's not bad, it's a VERY GOOD game and IS the same game than the home consoles (same history, same levels, same phase, same characters, etc.), but the developers removed a lot of features and even some gameplay aspects, maybe because of the hardware limitations of the PSP? Not enough space in the UMD? I don't know.

In the PSP version a lot of things were removed, for example, the ""puzzle"" were you have to move the crate in the Charon boat was removed (along some other little puzzles like this). Other things removed were the mini-game that plays when you absolve a soul, also ALL of the relics were removed (you don't collect relics in the PSP version, just the Silver Coins) and some parts that were playable in the home console version are now converted to video (a video plays showing the action that was playable in the home console).

A lot of sounds were removed too making the PSP version somewhat a bland one in the sound aspect, this is hard to explain but you can notice it if you played the home console version which is richer in sounds of the tormented souls, fire and beast of the inferno; fortunately all the voices from the different characters are intact. In the graphics department I give it credit, some of the best graphics I've seen on the PSP, no complains here. Now for the camera... terrible, I don't know what happened to the camera in the PSP version but I can't see anything, in the middle of a fight the camera is totally useless and I always get beaten by enemies I can't even see because the camera just focus a small portion of the scene, frustrating at times.

It is still a VERY good game, and considering it is PORTABLE and you can play it ANYWHERE makes it totally awesome despite being a version with less features... but this trip to the inferno is much more appreciated in the home console version of the game, that's why this is getting 4 stars.",4.0,B0029ZUPYK,"Excellent game, but go for the home console version if you can",Video Games
"Probably one of the best JRPGs I've played in a long time since Bravely Default and even longer before then. The past LoH games generally have a very slow start and a complex battle system that isn't newbie friendly. This game has a good balance of hand holding and letting you figure things out on your own. The pacing is well done in a way that makes the game very linear, but you don't really notice or mind it. There is plenty of hidden content and missable sidequests along the way. The random banter with other students and their hidden storylines makes it very interesting to speak to every npc ever. Whenever anything happens, a shift in day to night, next day, every npc has something new to say, to continue the storyline they live in, and you get little glimpses of it. Combat is very fun, seemingly simple, yet complex at the same time. Fights either go exactly as you plan with flawless execution, or you mess up and end up losing half your party in one turn. I've never had to grind at all through my journey in this game either, so there is no boring level wall to get to the next part of the story. The individual storylines of the main characters in your party are great too, even though the interactions between one another seem forced sometimes. The detail in the environment is amazing, every single zone you visit looks very well done.

"BioShock is a game from game developer 2K. I'll give it the fact that is a very interesting concept for a game. It takes place in the 1960s, and there is a zombie appocalypse in the underwater city of Rapture. The game is fun and all, but it is very hard. Not only that, but the large world of Rapture is very confusing to me. There are many doors and crevises throughout the area. For a game that came out in 2007, this is an extremely fun game. One of my favorite abilities is the ability to hack enemy equipment to make it yours. For instance, if there is an enemy turret, you can hack it to make it yours. It will then kill enemys. This isn't your average Zombie game. Its not just shoot and run. There is an actual goal to the game.

"Mass Effect is one of the rare, original titles you're likely to see in a year, a cross between Halo and Final Fantasy type playing it offers FPS style gameplay with third-person pov control in an RPG enviroment with great story, lots of side-quest and choices to make that effect the how the story progresses. For those of us who find games like Oblivion and Fallout 3 to be too open, too wide and too daunting this is a great game.

The story begins simply with a fairly long chapter that eases you into the game without being a boring tutorial. At the end of you will become the first human ""spector"" - a CIA like opporitive charged with tracking a traitor who is threatening the univirse. Once the opening is complete you have a ship and the galaxy is at your disposal, you can roam free and explore, follow side quest in your journal or go on about the main mission. You pick up six party members along the way and can take two at a time, just like with FF, they have to be in your party to earn experience and you have to keep them all armed and have the equipment updated and modified.

Here's the downside, the menu screen sucks. Arming your parting and upgrading and modifying weapons and armor is boring and time consuming. The screen requires you to keep clicking to other screens and then back for each weapon and each mod and each character gets four weapons and 2 mods per plus armor with mods.

The level up is a familular point-distribution that lets you decide were your stronger and when.

The battle is supposed to be complex, it's got RPG style controls that allow you to control your party, but it's clunky and annoying, I just let the npg's do thier thing and worry about the main character -- who can be male or female and decently customized but will always be ""sheppard"" so I made the first name ""German.""

I run on all settings high with 60fps @ 900X1400 resolution and have no lag, screen tear or loading times.

I also have this on Xbox 360 -- loading is constant, but fairly quick, screen tears regularly and the graphic quality is inferior. Also, the controls are better suited to all the keys on your keyboard, the XBox controller is frustrating.

"After reading many negative reviews about this game I opted to rent it instead of buying it. Wise decision. The game, in a lot of ways, is very cool. You get to be a samurai and hack people to shreds with many different swords. Also, you can pretty much kill whoever you want and choose which clans you want to fight with or against. You can use deception to get what you want or you can be loyal to one clan. This idea is very cool for a game and I wish more games would utilize it. However, there are many bad points about this game:
First of all, as most people have said on here, the save system is the worst I have ever seen in a video game. It is hands down, terrible. Very sloppy and just plain dumb. Second of all, the camera angles can be unbearable at times. You will be fighting someone and then all of a sudden, oops, you can't see him, or you or anything but a wall or something. Very shotty camera work. This can be overlooked at times, but other times it makes you want to throw your controller through a wall. Also, the graphics leave a little to be desired and sometimes the overall view you get of the game is quite [poor]. Also, the game is quite short.
The gameplay is fun during combat...when you are having swordfights with enemies, it is quite fun to hack them up and develop new moves to fight with. Combine that with the idea behind the game and you get the reasons I gave it 3 stars.

"I'm an RTS junkie.  I have nearly every RTS game on the Xbox.  That of coruse doesn't mean I PLAY a lot of RTS games on the Xbox, because most of them are terrible, crash, lag like crazy, etc.

Here's the goods and bads of Halo Wars

The graphics are simple, but they work.  There's really nice lighting effects, shading, dimension, etc.  It works.  It won't win awards, but it works.

The game is SOLID - no lagging, no crashing, even in HUGE conflicts with multiple units running around.  I've never had a single problem, and that's a FIRST for a console RTS.

The controls are easy.  I've never seen a shorter learning curve on a console RTS.  The options stay in the same place with every building or unit.  You quickly get to the point where you can point, click, flick-click and exit out of the menu, and have 100% confidence that what you wanted, you'll get.

Now, the bad stuff...

Halo Wars left out the most important part of an RTS game - the ability to create groups.  A lot of times you end up with critical units - units that MUST survive - for whatever reason.  But you have no way to select just that unit, or MORE IMPORTANTLY, select every unit BUT that unit.  One of my favorite ways to play RTS games is to build fleets of identical size and unit counts.  Each fleet will have everything from infantry to assault vehicles.  I then flank my enemy from multiple directions with these fleets, stretching their resources thin until my three fleets effectively reach ""the middle,"" and wipe out the bad guys.

This strategy simply isn't possible with Halo Wars.  You can do it once - the initial attack.  You'll have to group your fleets in common areas, select the area and issue the command.  Once the groups have begun to spread or mingle with each other, you can't separate them anymore.  How in the world you can build an RTS without the grouping feature is beyond me.

The units are pretty weak - they die easily.  The unit counts are low - too low to support defense strategies with any more than 2 or 3 bases.  The bases themselves are a total dissapointment.  As another reviewer commented, they're ""cookie cutter"" bases.  Each base consists of a central ""hub"" with anywhere from 3 to 7 ""pods"" around it, and you can selet what you want in each pod.  There's no feeling of ""home"" with any base - no pride in your design - and that kills it.

Halo Wars is a flawless interface with a sub-par RTS game.  It's not bad, but it certainly isn't great.",3.0,B0017HW5LM,One GLARING omission...,Video Games

"If it just worked dang it!
Ghost Recon is a tense FPS type game with high marks for combat tactics and realisim.  The key to playing and winning is ""see the bad guy first"" which is easier said than  done.  The single player game consists of 15 missions in which you control 6 Recon soldiers.  The idea is to accomplish all of  your mission goals. If you can pull this off, no mean feat, the game will open ""specialist"" soldiers that have somewhat better weapons and combat experience (stats) allowing you to ""take"" them along on your next mission.  If you think you know small arms battlefield tactics this game will test you to the max.
Ghost Recon could have broken through to the top of the heap for type but unfortunately it is buggy as heck.  I have had to do more work-arounds and adjustments to my computer in getting the game to run than any other game I have ever played (and I play a lot of computer games by-the-way). GR was originally scheduled for release after the first of the year however it hit the shelves about three months early (to cash in on holiday sales probably) and it plays and feels like it - just not quite finished.

The gameplay of this title was fairly boring, with several of the levels being less than 1 minute long before another extremely long cutscene.
Cutscenes aside, this game really had nothing to offer me by way of gameplay.  Sneaking is really not necessary in this game as blasting your way through the few enemies you find is far easier than trying to run around them.

"When I purchased my SEGA Dreamcast not too long ago, the first game I had in mind was Jet Grind Radio.  Word of mouth said it was a stylish, fun, innovative game and well worth the purchase.

Well, that's only partially true.

See, while this game is very cool and stylish (with nice cel-shaded graphics and interesting character design, as well as fitting music and sound of acceptable - though not exceptional - quality), and undeniably innovative (the spray paint mechanics are original), it's just not that fun.  Here's why.

When I started playing, I was expecting something far more fast-paced.  But your character moves at a disappointingly-slow speed.  Also, the spray painting system, while fun at first, becomes boring and somewhat irritating.  It's no fun to have to repeat the same actions over and over again, and nothing is worse than being shot at while your in the middle of tagging a building or sidewalk.

I would only recommend this game to someone who was interested in studying its cool and bold art style, or a die-hard SEGA fan, but to everybody else:  borrow it if you have the chance (assuming you have a friend with a Dreamcast).

"I got this game for my son (4 years old).  He loves Dora and he loves playing video games.  All I had to do was turn this on for him and he did everything else!

This game is very age appropriate.  As Dora is walking around the different planets, there are choices for the child to make.  Either walk along the paths or find crystals and other hidden goodies.  This makes it interesting for the kid who's playing instead of just a boring walk here and there.  But it's not too complex that you can get lost.

The game guides you where to go so the player always feels successful and accomplished.  It requires some thinking and problems solving skills where you pick up items and have to figure out where to use them.

My son made it from Earth to the Purple Planet in several sessions which kept him entertained for a while.  The saving feature is very nice so the kids can play for 15 to 20 minutes at a time without having to go back.

"Yes, definitely a let down.  The original Still Life and it's unofficial precursor Post Mortem were both strong games with interesting story lines and sensible puzzles (except for the cookie puzzle!!!).  Both of those games also had a supernatural element in them that was done with a very light touch and did not distract from the mystery part of the story.  And in my opinion Still Life's artwork was beautiful, if a little disturbing.  Still Life 2 has none of those finer qualities.  The only positive thing it has going for it is I think the voice actor is the same for the main character (Victoria McPherson) but other than that the game is just a complete disappointment to Still Life fans.

As the previous reviewer remarked, the story line is a mess and at some points unintelligible.  I think Microids originally planned to have Still Life continue online but because of financial/managerial reasons couldn't do it.  I think this is the result, a cobbled together version of an installment game that never quite makes sense (because some installments were cut?) and heads toward a conclusion very, VERY slowly.  The timed puzzles, the multiple character viewpoints, the out of nowhere characters (there is little character interaction, you just learn by reading reports how someone is known to/by Vic) just did not make for a fun or interesting game.

To add to the frustration, the load times were sloooooo[...]  Seriously walking from room to room there was a three second lag between screens...this doesn't sound like a long time until you have to walk from room to room, level to level, searching for something REPEATEDLY.

"To someone unfamiliar with the show this game is based on Retro Game Challenge is going to seem really odd.  It's a selection of retro style games within a strange framework.  Anyone familiar with Game Center CX will instantly understand the premise, and all the references said framework provides.  Anyone else might be left scratching their head.

The studio tried very hard to make the title appealing to a wide audience by localizing much of the content, but for a fan of the show it detracts a little.  I was looking forward to hearing the Cheif cheer me on while I played my way through the various challenges.  No matter how you look at it they were in for a tough time selling this quirky game.  With no televised property to tie in with RGC is easily overlooked.

The fact remains, in spite of all of that stuff, that Retro Game Challenge is a lovingly crafted game.  Much more so than most 3rd party games.  Each of the sub games is fully playable, and you unlock them after you complete a certain number of challenges for free play.  Although they are all new games they really do exactly capture the feel of games made in the early days of console gaming.  Nintendo would charge a person $30 for any one of these games if they ported them from the NES, but you get them ALL for much less than that.

The challenges themselves can be quite difficult, especially if there is a type of game you aren't good at.  I got stuck early on in the racing game.  I was never good at that type of game, so it was a battle to complete the second task.  When I finally did it I was relieved, and felt maybe a little more accomplished than I should have.  XD  It very much reminded me of Arino throwing his hands up and celebrating after competing one of his many challenges.

This game was, very unfortunately, overlooked.  The sequel will likely never make it to the US, and that is tragic, because it isn't just one solid game, but a whole stack of them.

"Upon someone's suggestion I decided to try one of these.  I didn't see any other similar products that didn't look to be of a really low quality, so I went ahead with this.

First of all, as you'll note others saying, there are issues with the built in battery.  It doesn't charge well (and gets worse very quickly over time.)  More importantly though, it tries to force too much power through at once or shorts out or something, so drains the battery even faster (and getting it even hotter) and even has been reported in some cases to damage chargers (I did not test this much, so can't comment on how true this is or is not.)  In the case of mine, it was already so bad by the time I got it as to make the charger part useless.  It would not even hold enough charge to power the DS for more than a second after the orange light came on before it would quit (and this is even with the DS turned off.)  After some deliberation I decided it wasn't worth trying to send back as I bought this for the grip rather than the charger and simply cut that part off (though if you have the security screwdriver it would be better simply to disable it as that part works very nicely to help hold the DS in place -- despite that it seems to have been intended for that though, my DS seems to stay in well.  If I need an emergency charger, I have a USB charging cable and there are many devices that can power USB devices via a battery.  Now I just use it as a grip.  Which brings me to my second point.

As a grip, it's not so bad.  I wish it were a little thinner in the middle to give the sides more roundness.  Also, it still doesn't perfectly solve the problem that some games can be a little rough on the hands (particularly Mario Kart) so it may not be ideal for everyone (but then it doesn't help that my hands are just the wrong size apparently -- small for an adult, but large for a child.)  I do still get some discomfort from time to time and can see some room for improvement here and there, but, overall it does succeed in making using a DS Lite easier on the hands by a fair margin.  One thing I like is how it uses the stylus holder to help hold the DS in and provides a stylus holder in itself to compensate.  Sadly though, the stylus can be really hard to pull out of the provided holder with this grip which might be a problem in some games requiring one to work quickly.

PS.  Remember people, even lithium ion batteries loose capacity as you use more recharge cycles.  If your DS has been used for a long time, you may just need a new battery more than you need any sort of backup charger.  I would suggest that if you are considering this product, you should consider it more on the merits as a grip than any sort of backup power system.  I do rate it a 3/5 because it has a decent amount of room for improvement as a grip, but overall I feel like it's worth the relatively small amount I spent on it.",3.0,B000NKPE4E,Works pretty well as a grip -- bad as a battery,Video Games

"I play a lot of games on both the PS3 and the Xbox 360 and I have to say that Uncharted 2 is my favorite out of all of them.  Other games, like Mass Effect and Assassin's Creed 2, come close, but no other game combines the overall polish, playability and fun quite so perfectly as Uncharted 2: Among Thieves.

If you read my review of the original Uncharted: Drake's Fortune you will see that I had very high praise for that game as well.  What's amazing, though, is that despite how incredible the first Uncharted was, the sequel betters it in nearly every way.  The gameplay is even more dynamic, with enhanced stealth and traversal mechanics, which gives you more options about how to approach a given combat scenario.  I've had fun trying to beat some sections of the game using nothing but stealth.  Another neat addition to Uncharted 2 is the way so many of the environments you find yourself fighting in are actually dynamically moving under your feet--from moving trains and trucks to crubling buildings--which actually affects your character's movement, as well as your aim.  Many games would handle scenerios like this through cut scenes, but getting to actually play through such moments is exhilarating.

The narrative that weaves through Uncharted 2 is of Hollywood movie caliber.  No, strike that, it's actually better than many Hollywood movies.  The characters have dimension and are entirely believable.  The main characters are so likeable and you can't help but root for Nathan and his friends.  The pacing, both in terms of storytelling and gameplay, is nearly flawless.  It is very hard to put down the controller once you start.

The graphics are also outstanding and are probably the most impressive I have ever seen in a video game.  There is such an amazing attention to detail and the textures, lighting and post-processing effects come together to create an extremely believable world.  The art direction and level design are so great and you find yourself in these immense, beautiful locations that just take your breath away sometimes.

On top of all this, Uncharted 2 brings a full suite of multiplayer modes that were not present in the first game.  And they are really good.  I am a high ranking Uncharted 2 player online and I play the multiplayer modes almost every day.  I've played online with Killzone 2, Gears of War 2, Halo 3, etc, etc and I can honestly say that I find the multi-player portion of Uncharted 2 to be more refined and enjoyable than any of them.  The way you can climb and jump around the levels makes the gameplay very dynamic and fluid--Gears of War 2, for example, feels very clunky and slow in comparison.  Another thing I really like about Uncharted 2 online is the fact that I actually use nearly every weapon in the game, whereas in many online games I mainly stick to one or two weapons.  All of the weapons in Uncharted 2 are really well balanced and they all have their strengths and weaknesses which allow for different strategies.  In a given match I usually find myself switching between about 5 different weapons.  Amazing all around!

In conclusion, Uncharted 2: Among Thieves is the full package.  The single player campaign by itself is among the best experiences I have ever had.  The characters, the narrative, the gameplay and the presentation are all a notch above and exude a sense of polish and attention to detail that is simply amazing.  Add on top of that one of the most well-designed multiplayer offerings and you simply can't go wrong with this game.  Naughty Dog, the developer, should be commended.  Uncharted and Uncharted 2 are both in my top 5 favorite games of all time and I can't wait to see what the talented guys and gals at Naughty Dog come up with next.",5.0,B001JKTC9A,My favorite game of all time!,Video Games

"it's a good game but to keep it concise--this game really should be anchoring and setting the standard for current-gen multiplayer...but it's not.

leave it to microsoft to muckup one of the best games (tried & proven).

the game engine seems jittery and at times, when strafing, you will get negative feedback which causes your character's movement to stutter.

context sensitivity for environment interaction (i.e. doing S.W.A.T. turns--peeling off of cover) are not there when they should be.  Devs missed a lot--when they shouldn't.  trying to aim from cover often results in peeling you off the wall instead.  The blind fire itself, if you're trying to pull compound actions is pretty unpredictable.  It's really watered down the complexity of what a player can do.  For example, wanna pull off a headshot around the corner from cover and then horizontally jump away?  Good luck executing, maybe 2 of the 3 will happen, jumping--not aiming, maybe jumping and pulling of the shot in some random order.  I don't know if it's my connection but at a solid 55mb down and 5 up--I should be good.

Everything multiplayer is sad.  Matchmaking is atrocious and takes terribly-long.  King of the Hill (annex) only lasts 1 round.  Expect about 5 minutes between multiplayer matches (finish-to-next-start).  Oh and if you make it to the finish screen after a match--the screen is locked.  You cannot exit until the next screen loads (maybe 45-60 seconds later).

grenade physics respond as though you're shotputting a 16-lb bowling ball.  Unless you deliberately hold L-trigger to actually bolo throw the grenade--good luck getting it farther than 2-feet from you.  (use at your own peril)

The gnasher seems to be its old self (finally a praise) but hip firing is very deceptive because if you use the direction of the shotgun as an indicator--you will be horribly misled and it's intensely counterintertuitive to fire at the center of the screen--ignoring the direction the muzzle is pointing.

This is my favorite series of all time and I was nothing less than ecstatic to play.  I have all but sworn off video games due to the gloomy and uninspired video game culture that seems to be trending and I was hopeful for this but sorely disappointed with the rerelease.

It is what it is and it's still a lot of fun to play multiplayer sans the looming flaws aforementioned.

"Magus is a game that is hard to describe.  Have you ever played a really bad game, yet somehow gotten a tiny smidgen of enjoyment out of it?  It's rare that such a thing occurs with video games, but somehow, Magus manages to do just that.  It's a light RPG/action/hack and slasher in which you play the title character, who is assisted by some chick named Kirra, in a mission of revenge for...something.  The story of Magus is hard to swallow, only because there is some painfully bad voice acting and dialogue peppered throughout the game that you can't help but skip through.  The core gameplay of Magus is run from room to room, area to area, taking down waves of enemies.  In between all that, you acquire various items and gems that make you stronger and level you up, along with some fairly nifty magic abilities as well.  The gameplay itself is kind of boring, yet somehow addictive.  The graphics are super dated, and the game itself is really glitchy, including your partner appearing and disappearing at random, and enemy AI that is just atrocious.  Yet still, somehow even with all that going against it, Magus is still somewhat enjoyable to play, even if it's only to marvel at its badness.  Thankfully the game is quite short.  If it were any longer, it would probably be safe to say that Magus wouldn't be worth checking out in the least and a chore to get through.  All that being said, if you want to play something that you don't have to devote a lot of time to and get some laughs out of at the same time, give this a glance.",3.0,B00E5UHXDI,It's bad...yet good.,Video Games

"I really enjoyed Batman: Arkham Asylum so I expected big things here.  Thankfully, Arkham City keeps all the good elements of the first game, makes some improvements, and adds enough new elements that the experience still feels fresh.

The one major downside to Arkham Asylum to me was the need to almost constantly use the X-ray vision mode to see where thugs were lurking around corners in order to plan stealth attacks in relatively small spaces.  This time around, the city environment allows for much greater movement, and the lighting makes it easy to see enemies without going to X-ray mode, while still keeping a dark atmosphere.  Strategy is still needed since some of the bad guys carry guns, but I no longer feel like I'm playing the role of a ninja, taking out one guy and scurrying back into the shadows.  It's very cool to look to the sky and see the bat-signal indicating the direction of your current primary objective.

The number of melee attacks you can unlock is so extensive it felt overwhelming at first.  Fortunately you have the option to have a prompt come up at the bottom of the screen when your combo meter is high enough to use advanced attacks.  The more sophisticated and varied your fighting style, the more XP points you get to unlock more abilities and upgrade your armor.

Then there are the hundreds of Riddler trophies to obtain.  Some are merely hidden from sight, while others are in plain view but require solving a puzzle to free them for collection.  There is even a device that involves chaining letters together to form words to solve some of the riddles.  There are also various challenges like gliding a certain distance, performing certain attacks successfully, and destroying Joker teeth, each of which awards a Riddler trophy.  Just collecting all the trophies is like a game in itself, and is a nice way to break up the action.  Also, you can hold down the L2 button to mark a Riddler trophy on your map if you can't currently retrieve it.  Tip: If there is no evident way to get to a trophy, mark it and move on.  Many require gadgets that you may not have yet, and the red ones can only be obtained by Catwoman.

Catwoman has really nice martial arts attacks, can use her whip and other weapons, and can make repeated jumps to scale a building in place of Batman's grappling hook.  She definitely feels fully developed and in no way tacked on as a promotional gimmick.

Batman's gliding ability combined with being able to grapple from midair makes it easy to get around the city.  It's fun, the physics are well done, and it is practically useful.

The graphics in this game are some of the best I've ever seen.  I never have that sensation like in some sandbox games where the buildings look painted into the background and unrealistic.  It really feels like a living, breathing world, especially since there are always optional side missions popping up and bad guys lurking and chatting about what's going on.  The voice acting is very good, especially Mark Hamill's portrayal of The Joker.

AI in this game is impressive.  If I take out one in a gang with stealth and the others find him, they go on alert and actively search.  This means altering their patrol patterns, staying closer together, and turning around much more often to watch their backs.  It's a refreshing change from games where guys go on alert for a minute, then return to mindlessly walking the exact same path and begging to be picked off.  The game is challenging but never cheap, and if you have trouble with certain elements of fighting you can upgrade accordingly.  The ability to throw down a smoke pellet when coming under gunfire is a great addition.

I don't have a bad thing to say about this game.  I'm not one to go overboard with praise and ignore flaws, but there are no issues here.  No bugs, no collision detection problems, no slowdown despite the huge scale of the city, no painful logic gaps in the story or motivation.  You can tell Rocksteady had a great engine to start with, and spent their time fixing issues and expanding gameplay in creative ways.  Too often I get frustrated during a game and wonder ""didn't the developers care if this is actually fun to play?"".  During the many hours I've spent in Arkham City, I have only asked that once, which was when I was first learning how to glide.  There is no tutorial and I had to go online to figure out how to dive and pull up.  That temporary problem aside, the game is nonstop fun, with enough challenge that I've died numerous times in ways that left me saying ""I need to plan better next time"".  This is the sort of game where you're saying goodbye to months of your life when you pick it up, which you should do right now.",5.0,B002I0F5M8,This game lives up to the hype in every way,Video Games

"Wow, didn't think I'd run into this game again. I only ever rented this game, as it came out way towards the end of the N64 era of video gaming. Nevertheless, it was always an extremely fun game to me and I recently revisited it at a friend's house. Boy, did playing it again bring back memories!

Once upon a time, I would rent this game and play it nonstop. The gameplay is simple yet challenging at the same time, especially once you make it to the optional worlds. Not to mention trying to get the rare pieces of armor in each level is also a fun challenge.

The story: you possess the elemental stone of fire and are on your way home from a long vacation to a hot springs planets where you found a curious looking egg.  Suddenly, a black hole sucks you in and you wake up in a jail cell. The egg hatches to introduce Pommy, who evolves throughout the game based on the food you obtain by killing enemies and destroying boxes. You begin to meet various Elemental Knights (one of which is VERY familiar to fans of the first BM64 game, but I won't spoil it) and a mysterious woman named Lillith. Together with Lillith you attempt to stop an insidious plot to revive a god and, at the same time, destroy the black hole and get home.

The story is excellent, but what was the one problem with the game? It's way too easy to die, especially when you reach the amusement park world and encounter a puzzle with spikes that are incredibly easy to touch and will kill you on impact. And also, unlike many games, the final boss is incredibly difficult. This may give kids who thinks ""It's an E game, so it's easy"" a rough time. The last uber annoyance may be the save feature. You need to beat a level to save. Otherwise you must restart the level, which can be an absolute pain on the last three levels especially.

Final word: All in all I must say that this is one of my favorite games of all time and I spent hours and hours of game time (and then some). Therefore, I am proud to give this game a 4.75 star rating in the fun factor. However, due to the problems that may give players a bit of difficulty, overall, I give it 3.5 stars.",3.0,B00004S2W5,Pommy!,Video Games

"Although the game does not follow the book (or the movie) as well as it could, that allows for you to have a unique experience. Even though you know how the end will be (if you've seen the movie or read the book), the story of getting there is unique.

"Ah the Metal Gear Solid series. Many know about it, many play it. It is a staple in videogames. Some say that the original Metal Gear Solid revolutionized the way videogames are viewed. Here is the third in this amazing series and though I beat it well over a year ago, here is my review.

In Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater, rival nations are secretly developing weapons that could threaten the future of mankind. Deep in the jungle, an elite tactical soldier must combine stealth with survival to infiltrate the enemy and stop a weapon of mass destruction from triggering the largest full-scale war the world has ever seen. The game is set in a sweltering jungle where players must fight for survival by battling relentless natural elements, as well as an onslaught of ruthless enemy soldiers. In my opinion, the story is the best aspect of the game. It is such an amazing, emotional rollercoaster ride that does not let up till the credits are completely over. I mean, this game takes real events and interweaves its own fictional story through them while keeping all the events true to history (it takes place in 1964 as most of you well know). The characters in this game are just simply amazing. They feel like real people. Throughout the game you come to care about these characters, more so than in any other videogames I've ever seen. Without spoiling anything for those who haven't played this yet (shame on you) at the end of the game at the last boss battle there is this one character who you just want to kill. They have been nothing but a pain and all you want to do at that point is kill them. But, in true Kojima fashion, the battle doesn't start right away. No no, that character gives a speech. A speech that makes you literally, no lie here, go from hating them to realizing how awesome and great of a person/character they are and not want to kill them. And when you finally do kill them, it tears you up inside. Of course, through the end cut scene (which in my opinion is the best ending and cut scene ever in a videogame) you learn more about this character and why they did what they did and you care even more about them, even though they are dead. And the final shot in the game is a tearjerker. If you care about these characters, feel for them what they had to go through and were wrapped up in the story, you probably will cry. I did and it's just that good. That's a testament to the brilliance of Kojima. He can make you care about a character that isn't even real.

The graphics in this game are just phenomenal. Everything is richly textured and is stunning to look at. The character models are gorgeous. Especially the facial expressions, those are damn impressive. Everything is extremely fluid in the way things move; the mo-cap was used very well in the creation of this game. Everyone moves so lifelike, it is scary sometimes cause you actually feel like these are real people. All the environments look realistic, like they could exist in real life and vary in each section you go to. You never once feel like ""I was just through here!"" (Unless you in fact do go back in that area).

The sound is simply amazing as well. The score by Harry-Gregson Williams is extremely powerful and riveting. The music is very catchy and goes absolutely perfect with the game. I myself enjoyed the Theme Song a lot, it was a nice play on the 007 themes and is actually a cool song, it's on my iPod. The sound effects in are second to none. The guns sound like they should and the environmental sounds are just great. More than once you'll just stop and listen to the sounds of the jungle. And if you play it with surround sounds, you actually feel like you are there. All the animals sound realistic as well. The voice acting is superb as usual. As always, it's a huge leap above other games. David Hayter returns as Snake and does a superb job as always. Suzetta Mi?et is EVA and is good too. Jim Piddock voices Major Zero and is fantastic. Neil Ross and Josh Keaton play Volgin and Ocelot, respectively and Gregg Berger, Michael Bell, J. Grant Albrecht, Richard Doyle and David Thomas (no, not the Wendy's guy) voice the bosses The Pain, The Fear, The End, The Fury and The Sorrow, all respectively of course). A standout though is Lori Alan who voices The Boss. She adds something to the character. Something tough to put into words. If you play it you'll know. She does an exceptional job. The script is very tight and extremely well written with great dialogue and the amazing quotes are still here.

The gameplay is smooth and responsive. It controls nicely and the new features are cool. CQC is a blast to use. There are many different things you can do to the enemies. The camouflage works well and is fun to use. The survival aspect never gets in the way and adds another fun challenge and angle to this game.

Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater is the best game I have ever played. Period. It is a true masterpiece and honestly, I can only hope Guns of The Patriots annihilates it because if you can improve on MGS3, then you have one hell of a game. This game is nothing short of a masterpiece.",5.0,B0002RQ3ES,"Tactical Espionage Action. I call it, Simply Amazing!",Video Games

"Okay, I hesitated for months about buying and playing 'Mass Effect Andromeda' because of the horrible and angry reviews - I've bought and played the previous 3 ME games,, and even though each one was massively flawed, they still had their enjoyable aspects. So reading the reviews REALLY made me question whether to wasted my time on 'Andromeda' at all. Finally though, used copies are now on sale for $12, and how could I pass that up?

And now after about 3 weeks and 38% completion of the game so far, I can say; I can't understand what all the bad reviews from previous ME players is all about. It's absolutely a Mass Effect game, with all the same flaws all the previous ones had - so fans should be used to it by now. YES the character animation and rendering is pretty bad, and everyone walks and stands like they have large sticks in their butts - there's very little 'next gen' animation in the game. But I remember thinking that about the other ME games too, that they didn't 'stretch' the XBOX 360 abilities. So that's the same. Yes the combat is pretty much the same, which is not great. Yes the new aliens are still not aliens, even in a whole new galaxy - aliens are still just humans with funny heads, and have the exact same personalities, emotions, and motivations as humans. There's even a Turian female who sounds just like a human teenager! So that's still the same.

The main story itself is fairly interesting (although silly - I still don't get the point of traveling all the way to a new galaxy to start new colonies), and so far there seem to be a thousand side stories and side quests, which for me is a main selling point of games. I like to have a lot to do, and many of the side quests are very involving stories. As I've said, I'm over 3 weeks in and only have 38% completion! That's getting your money's worth.

The designers have also put in 'Research and Development', resource gathering, and kinda/sorta settlement building, which I hated in Fallout 4 and I""m not a fan of here either. I wish they would have put that time and effort into making the 'non-explorable' planets and solar systems more interesting, instead of 'scan this planet and find nothing oh well'. The research and building of armor, mods, and weapons can be pretty confusing as there's no way to tell which races equipment will be better until after you actually build them and compare, which leads to a lot of wasted resources.

And you still spend a HELLACIOUS amount of time driving around on a planet's surface, although the new NOMAD is much better than the old MAKO, which was so awful that I almost quit a couple of the previous games just so I wouldn't have to drive that monstrosity anymore. So saying the NOMAD is better, is really damning it with faint praise. It's not even armed, so you can't use it in any firefight.

The planets you visit are actually very nicely designed for the most part, with thought out ecologies and much better looking than the humans/aliens, and have 'fast travel' points to make it easier to get around - as some of those planetscapes are pretty big.

All in all if you're a Mass Effect player, the game is very similar to what you've played before, which can be either a plus or minus for you. For new players, try it with an open mind and see - it's long and involved and there's a lot to do, and if you don't have the patience for that, it won't be your thing. Also if you're looking for fantastic visuals, it also may not be your thing. For me so far the positives outweigh the negatives - if I could give it 3 1/2 stars I would, but I'll bump it up to 4 for the complexity.",4.0,B01GW3NY5Q,"Not nearly as good as you'd hope, but not nearly as bad as you've heard",Video Games
"Given the niche but positive reputation this game has, I was very excited to give it a try. I even saved up for it and got myself in the JRPG mind set to play it. And I love Atlas too so I thought this would be a great gaming experience.

I was utterly shocked at how indescribably boring Disega was. It is just a giant grind fest with annoyingly tricky camera angles and somewhat interesting characters.

The story feels like it was made for 10 year oldswhich is fine, except the people who recommend this game are in their late teens/20s.

The gameplay is unique, but the controls feel tedious and taxing. Why would you need to click Execute to attack? Why not just press attacklike every other game in existence?  And why doesnt the left button move the cursor left?! This was soooo annoying! You click up and the pointer goes to the left, and left moves you down. How did they screw up this basic function!

Its not difficult by any meansits just grindy. Really, really grindy. Put that on top of an uninspired combat-system and I was sick of it by the time my 4th hour of gameplay rolled around. I can think of a dozen better JRPG games for the DS and all of them are far more fun.

"In Iraq we found that even a Superpower can be crippled by an insurgency led by a dedicated group that is far less technologically advanced than ourselves.  In the present video game, the tables are turned.  The game operates in an alternative reality where a North Korean company became a leading defense contractor back in the 1970s.  The U.S. gobbled up their hardware and kept buying more stuff.  Eventually, the U.S. got to $30 trillion in debt and defaulted on its bills.  The North Korean company then flipped a ""back door"" switch which disabled all of our military technology & hardware.  This left us vulnerable to an invasion ~ which is precisely what North Korea did.

Naturally, there is a low-tech resistance group that uses guile and deception against an enemy that is technologically superior.  Your character is a member of this resistance.  While defeating the North Koreans is something of an impossible task, the ultimate goal is to inflict such a heavy price on their occupation that they will choose to withdraw (similar to what happened to us in Iraq).

This game had a lot of promise & potential.  Conceptually, it is an interesting video game playground.  The main problem with the game lies in its playability.  When you sneak up behind a bad guy, it should not be as complicated as it is to simply take them out.  Most video games of this sort allow you to pause while you switch weapons.  In this game you have to do it ""on the fly.""  Sometimes the button skips and you get the wrong weapon, which is frustrating.  However, the single most annoying feature of the game is that you must fully reload a shotgun B4 using it.  Countless times my character would be nonchalantly reloading the shotgun while getting blasted by a bad guy.  Every other game of this sort that I've ever played has allowed you to reload the shells and fire w/out reloading the weapon all the way.

"Far back as I can remember I was in love with role playing games. From discovering the hobby with buying Dungeons and Dragons at a garage sale to playing Ultima 3 on my C-64. Role playing games allow us an escape from everyday life. Now NIS (the creator of the Disgaea series) have created a new series called The Guided Fate Paradox. But is this a journey that you will want to go on or should you just stay home?

The plot behind The Guided Fate Paradox centers around a 17 year old named Renya. He goes on to say that he is very unlucky and has never won anything in his life. While in a mall he comes across a cute girl in a maid outfit. She coerces him to spin the wheel as he might win a prize and he eventually does so. It turns out he has won the grand prize and the prize is that he is to become God. Renya is stunned and at first doesnt believe her but it turns out she is an angel named Liliel. The angel transports him to Celestia and explains that his job is to alter the fates of the people that pray to him.

What Renya has to do is enter the Fate Revolution Circuit and explore the areas within. In these dungeons various monsters manifest as the persons fears and slaying these monsters help them overcome these doubts. This is one of the most interesting concepts I have ever seen in an RPG and the story is very engaging with cutscenes and great voice acting.

The dungeons that you enter are randomly generated almost giving you a rogue-like experience. Each time you enter a dungeon you will encounter different enemies, various traps and gimmicks that can hinder your progress. Unlike other games where the action occurs in real time this is a turn based game. Nothing will happen unless you move and you can get the jump on some enemies attacking them before they can even see you.

You will not be going alone in the dungeon however as you can have one angel accompany on your expedition. Each of these angels has various powers and can turn the tide of battle. There are also various items you can find in the dungeon that you can equip or give to one of your angels. Later on there are huge boss battles that will require you to think and plan out your actions to beat these superior foes.

If you are a fan of some of the earlier Disgaea games or want a change from the traditional RPGs you need to get this game.",4.0,B00BJH11D8,An RPG where you become God,Video Games

"I'm a big fan of the Uncharted series, but I mainly want this review to be about the system. That's why you're really buying this set, right?
...but briefly: I loved Uncharted, and I own Uncharted 2, both great...Uncharted 3 just doesn't have the drama that those two games had, but it does have some great moments of gameplay.

  On to the system: I bought this, because I like portability. I got the PS3, soon after it came out (but, not soon enough to get one of the PS2 backwards compatible ones). Obviously, this system is smaller, and much lighter.
  Another thing I disliked about my first PS3: the noise. My PS3 is my whole entertainment system, for my bedroom; I hated watching a film, or listening to music, and hearing the loud fan noise, especially when the fan boosted to compensate for the heat. This system is so quiet that I unplugged it, because I thought it was already off (and my head was about 6"" away).

  There are design improvements: The system doesn't get as hot, and there are less air vents (and better designed). So, dust isn't as big of a problem, with the slim. The matte finish isn't the fingerprint leech that its predecessor was (and if you purchase a vinyl skin, you'll have even less to worry about). ...and, if you're interested in upgrading the hard drive, the PS3 slim's drive is much easier to remove.

  Usually, I don't hear any noise from the system, and my room is quiet enough for me to notice. In fact, my MacBook is louder than the PS3 Slim. Occasionally, I do hear the drive scanning/loading a disk, but I haven't noticed any change in performance, going from an 80GB PS3 fat, to the 320GB PS3 slim.

  I recommend getting a vinyl skin (for the ps3) (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bundle-Monster-Vinyl-Skin-Sticker-For-PlayStation-PS3-S-SLIM-Game-Console-Cover-Protector-Art-Decal-Dragon-Ying-Yang/dp/B004MD7ZTU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bundle Monster Vinyl Skin Sticker For PlayStation PS3 S SLIM Game Console - Cover Protector Art Decal - Dragon Ying Yang</a>), a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/PS3-Silicone-Controller-Sleeve-Black/dp/B0010YCZ1C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">PS3 Silicone Controller Sleeve - Black</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Clorox-Disinfecting-Wipes-Fresh-Scent-75-Count-Tubs-Pack-of-6/dp/B000EIDRRQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Clorox Disinfecting Wipes, Fresh Scent, 75-Count Tubs (Pack of 6)</a>, and some covers for the unused ports - such as this:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cosmos-Clear-silicone-anti-dust-stopper-plug-set-2x-USB-2x-3-5mm-earphone-mic-jack-1x-SD-card-slot-1x-mini-display-port-1x-1394-fireware-1x-RJ45-for-macbook-PRO-regular-AIR-aluminum-unibody-Cosmos-cable-tie/dp/B0054U85OE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cosmos Clear silicone anti-dust stopper/plug set - 2x USB, 2x 3.5mm earphone/mic jack, 1x SD card slot, 1x mini-display port, 1x 1394/fireware, 1x RJ45 for macbook PRO/regular/AIR aluminum unibody + Cosmos cable tie</a>&nbsp;(USB+Ethernet...not sure if there are covers for the A/V port, HDMI, or optical).

"It's very rare that you see an item on amazon.com with over 100 reviews and 5-stars. No matter how good something is; it's usually at 4.5...
Not Advance Wars, though. It's just that good! A turn-based strategy game for Game Boy Advance; it resembles Command-and-Conquer with its tanks, bases, planes; etc.
With several game modes including a campaign to play after you complete the mandatory training ... you deploy troops at bases that capture other bases and fight the enemy. Some maps have ports for ships and/or airports to build planes and helicopters as well.
Holding these bases, along with cities, is how you collect your income at the beginning of each turn. The interface is very slick; you can always find out everything about a unit or square by hitting the 'R' button.
You also get to pick a commander to lead your troops, and they all have strengths and weaknesses as well as special abilities. The Naval CO can unleash Tsunamis on units, but his planes aren't the best in the sky...

"PROS
- Fun game
- VATS is something new for gaming.
- Open world with a lot to do (more than almost any other non-Bethesda game).
- Bethesda is a top developer. Todd Howard seems to be a great guy.
- A lot more voice acting than in prior Bethesda releases.
- Controls. Bethesda has the greatest view/camera system in the industry in my opinion. Simply click a button and you're in 1st person, click again you're in 3rd person -- all games should do this in my opinion -- it should be standard.

NEUTRAL
- Bobblehead. meh.
- Far less glitching and bugs than Oblivion. Oblivion had far fewer than Morrowind. Thus Bethesda is getting better and better at debugging.

CONS
- Pip-Boy is a poorly designed battery killer.
- Graphics and animation have unfortunately not been improved since the time of Oblivion. This was a key disappointment to me. I know everything is supposed to look run-down and devastated, but that doesn't mean it has to look graphically mediocre.

IS THIS AN IMPROVEMENT OVER OBLIVION?
- Not for me no.

IS THIS JUST OBLIVION WITH GUNS?
- Some will so no, some say yes. I say YES. It's little more than a re-skinned Oblivion with guns + VATS...and to that I say ""fine by me"".

WHAT VERSION OF WHAT PLATFORM TO GET?
- PC/360 get DLC so stick with those. PC if you prefer mouse. I prefer joystick, so 360 for me. Definitely do NOT buy the Amazon Exclusive Edition. Sold out by now, but if you see it via Amazon Marketplace sellers or on Ebay, know that the Pip-Boy is going to be a paperweight.

"I played the first 3 Uncharted episodes on PS4 and I thought they were fantastic!  All the different things to do, all the places, all the challenges, and great stories.  So when I saw the phenomenal reviews for Uncharted 4 I thought this was going to be the pinnacle.  But like a few others who separated from the pack, I found that Uncharted 4 was less likable than its closest rival, Tomb Raider Definitive Edition.  Why?
1) Starts off soooooo slow, to develop a story that seems totally irrelevant at times.
2) After several episodes, this becomes a rock climbing game.  Seriously, that's its claim to fame.  Unlike other Uncharteds that are filled with different things to do, this one focuses on climbing climbing climbing climbing, a whole bunch in the beginning and all throughout.
3) The stupid jeep thing. There's no map, so you can wander forever.  Can you get out and walk?  In FarCry 4 you'd be a fool to walk cause it would take forever in the massive map.  But here? The Jeep only goes a few meters before you have to stop, but you can't walk.  The jeep is here more of a cumbersome frustrating tool that you have to work around, not as a viable part of the game.  And for those who said that Uncharted 2 was not as great as 4 because of the ski-doos, I say those ski-doos were much more manageable than the jeep, and the story was even more fun.
4)Weapons?  Yes there are tons of different pistols and assault weapons hanging around--and the fight at the end (won't give that away). But in TR-DE you have bows and shotguns besides those in Uncharted, and napalm arrows.
5) Story--the end makes no sense--in two respects.  In terms of the one that got away and the gold.
I will recommend this game to somebody who is patient and likes to listen to good storytelling, but if you want a game that clicks from start to finish, I'd recommend Tomb Raider --Definitive over this one, and Uncharted 1 to 3 as the best of all.",3.0,B00GODZYNA,"No, this is a 3-star game.",Video Games
"RPG Maker 2 for the PS2 brings 3D adventure creation to the consoles. A great improvement over RPG Maker, the depth of games you can create with this is staggering.
First, if you haven't tried RPG Maker, the original, that is a simple 2-D adventure maker that could make games such as Final Fantasy 1 and 2. You had little 'wizards' and 'warriors' and such moving up, down, left and right through towns, dungeons, castles and forests. You could have simple dialogue, music and events. This might be a good starting system for someone very new to game creation, to help them learn in a very simple manner.
RPG Maker 2 launches into full 3 dimensional adventures, so you have to be able to think more seriously about the layout of your games. Instead of just having a ""flat world"" that you move through, you literally take blocks and create a 3D world, with stairs up to higher levels, hidden rooms, and much more. You can change the texture of every block, making giant cathedrals, small village huts, wooden bridges, and just about anything you can imagine.
You can connect a USB keyboard to type in long descriptions, and your choices of graphics, sounds and events are much more intense. As you might imagine, you can therefore take MONTHS and months to create huge adventure worlds. The tools are all there, but it takes a little while to get used to how they work, as with any new design system.
When your game is done, save it onto a memory card and trade it off to friends. This could be the perfect way to learn about game design and create something that others are willing to pay to play!
Highly recommended for aspiring game designers who are good with logic and complex design. I'd still recommend the original RPG Maker for younger kids who need to learn the 2D basics first.",5.0,B00008G7MM,Great Way to Learn How to Create Games,Video Games
"This game is a little difficult to reccomend to everybody, because it is not for everyone. It is a shooter, but do not expect something like Halo, because if you are aggressive in this game, you will die. It is a smarter game that requires more waiting and thinking. The controls are more difficult and the bullets are more deadly. It is also a squad-based game, but unfortunately, you will find some artificial intelligence issues with your other squad mambers. They too often kill themselves by not hiding or shooting, and unless you are constantly on top of their actions, which is undesireable, you run the risk of having them killed.

The first thing you will notice whie playing this game is that the graphics are absolutely beautiful. The graphics make this game very impressive, but unfortunatly, gameplay isn't as impressive. Sure, gameplay is good, but single player gameplay will not keep you coming back for more than one or two times.

Multiplayer on the other hand is great. That is, if you don't run into problems. There are many glitches that you will find online, and getting into a game session is painful, especially when you wait for over 10 mins to enter a game just to be thrown out after 10 seconds. This happened to me way too many times for me to over-look it. Also, offline miltiplayer is boring, uninteresting, and not fun.

So if you can over-look dificult controls, not-so-perfect gameplay, and a problem filled multiplayer feature, then you will find a game that has stunning graphics, and gameplay that will still bring you joy. And now that you can find this game for under $39, it is a good buy. thats why i give it a 4/5.",4.0,B000A0EFJW,Not as good as advertised...,Video Games

"My husband is a hunter and I go with him, but, I've never killed anything. Though, I liked this game more than he did. He thought the controllers were hard to manuver. I didn't think they were that difficult once you got used to it.

I enjoyed having to pick which cover to hide in and having to sneak up to the cover. It was also kind of a learning experience for me learning about where exactly to shot the animals to more humanely kill them. It was kind of tricky the first few times trying to get past the mountain lion. You really have to pound the heck out of the controller on tbe exact buttons it tells you to and then you have to immediately find the cat, aim and shoot straight. It was fun. I also liked the little bonus challenges like shooting the ducks and foxes.

The only thing that I didn't like was on the very last challenge. On the very last challenge you will have 2 cougars coming at you. I could never kill them. On that hunt it was too hard to see the cats. They will immediately come down from the hill/cliff they are on and the game won't let you aim at them until after they've jumped onto you. I mean, what hunter would not already be shooting if 2 dangerous cats where running at him or her??? Then after they have jumped onto you and you fight them off, it's nearly impossible to find them as they run behind you, in front of you, then to the side, so fast that it made it nearly impossible to take a good aim at them.
We don't have the gun (I'm not sure this would make a difference) with this and it was way too hard to find the cats as they moved too fast to take aim during the last challenge. I have to agree with my husband that the controller movement is awkward during the dangerous hunts, especially on the last hunt.

"FF XIII-2 continues three years after the first game left off. You assume the role of Serah, who now lives on a settlement on Gran Pulse. She's recently been having dreams where her big sister (and FF XIII main heroine) Lightning fights a mysterious foe in a place called Valhalla. She wakes up one night to discover that a meteorite has crashed down nearby, bringing with it a boy, Noel, who claims to be the last survivor of humanity from a far future. Noel has met with Lightning and was sent to Serah, he says, because the two of them must take a time-travelling adventure to unwind a paradox-filled history -- and that's exactly what they do.

The time-travel element may remind some players of Square classic Chrono Trigger, and the comparison isn't terribly far off. Serah and Noel hop around different eras and locations in the world's history, solving problems and opening portals to other eras and potential futures. Though parts of the story are still linear, you're given far more freedom to approach challenges in a way you personally enjoy. Don't feel like advancing the main plot at this time? Boss fight giving you trouble? Just hop to a different time period to explore and build strength for a while until you're content. Unlike the ""series of tubes"" that comprised most of FF XIII's structure up until later in the game, FF XIII-2 lets you progress at your own pace. With that freedom comes the sense of excitement and discovery that FF XIII sorely lacked, as finding hidden treasures and using clever strategy to topple monsters well above your strength level feels immensely satisfying. And if you ever feel like you might have missed something, you can rewind back to the beginning of certain event sequences to do things over while retaining your hard-earned rewards.

Not everything here is new, however. You'll see a lot of familiar locales, tunes, and designs from FF XIII peppered in-between all-new content. The recycling of some assets can be easily forgiven, however, when what's being reused was beautiful and well-made to begin with. Also returning is FF XIII's superb, fast-paced combat engine and the accompanying Crystarium leveling system, albeit with some significant overhauls. You now have more control over character development, as you can choose to level up specific Paradigm roles on the Crystarium board (as in FF XIII) while also unlocking additional roles and bonus boosts (stat gains, accessory capacity) after reaching certain levels. Moreover, battles continue on even after the initial player-controlled party leader has fallen, giving you a chance to regroup and make a comeback.

It's easy to see how Square Enix took the feedback from FF XIII and used it to make a better product, but this follow-up still has some lingering issues. Every so often you'll encounter an obnoxious gimmick sequence, such as a giant time-jumping fetch quest, a series of out-of-place logic puzzles, or constantly regenerating and unavoidable Cie'th enemy hordes chasing you throughout a massive maze. Plus, the story falters at times, falling victim to leaps of logic and silliness, and dialogue exchanges often feel like characters are simply talking at each other rather than truly interacting. The trademark Square Enix CG is sparse, with most story sequences rendered in-engine. But perhaps most annoying are the technical issues: framerates drop precipitously when a lot is happening onscreen, and this sequel's few movie sequences frequently suffer from hideously artifacted compression.

Maybe the best way to sum up Final Fantasy XIII-2 is with an oft-repeated line of dialogue from the game itself: ""Change the future to change the past."" It's not just a paradoxical plot point: FFXIII-2 repairs almost every problem with Final Fantasy XIII, delivering an experience that feels like what that original game should have been.

"I had to have this game. The graphics are slightly improved and the story is pretty cool, but it was definitley too short and no where near as challenging as it's predecessors. I would probably give this closer to 3 1/2 stars, but because it was part of Half-Life, which I believe is the FPS ever, I got it. Reliving some of the things that happened in the previous games was great and brought back good feelings, but it all ended too quickly. Still, the cut scenes and the story carried this one through.

"What a beautiful mouse. Has everything you will ever need for the average user. This isn't an MMO mouse or anything so don't expect myriad buttons and access to those kinds of features. It does have an extensive macro system though, and the features on the new firmware are pretty decent for this price range. At any rate mouse enthusiasts usually know what their mouses are for.

The side pads as many have said have a sweet feeling sandpaper-like compound... BUT this doesn't last as long as one would like for the thumb position IF you use the mouse a lot. MANY mice today use that decrepit shiny and sticky plastic for where your thumb/pinky finger goes...

The feeling after this compound wears down is akin to a slightly stickier plastic. The plastic itself is hard enough so the feeling is never too annoying; I must stress how important this is, because a soft and sticky plastic for my thumb and other fingers will have me wanting to throw the mouse away nearly immediately. I wish the normal sandpaper feel had been able to keep itself for at least 6 months. But this is still much better than my last mouse in feel and touch. I love the overall design of it.  I'm just grateful they didn't go with that nasty, shiny stuff CM used on my Havoc.

Anyway, I updated firmware and installed software in 2 minutes. While not quite the extensive system of options that CM has, this mouse for the time being has topped my old Havoc which had the aforementioned sticky plastic problem requiring tape. Otherwise I think CM's software is better and allows a lot more functionality with LEDs and a couple other things. What is there is pretty decent and you can tune each axis on the pad and have three different slots for DPI, easily reachable below the scroll wheel. A single, small and red LED light is for the first slot and this goes to three lights. They are pretty low key and not too bright. I shut off the Corsair logo as it was too bright and annoying for my tastes.

I am not sure what the native specs are on the DPI sensor but I use about 900-1200 on my desktop and it feels about perfect. I certainly don't need much higher. My PC gaming is mostly done with a controller, but scrolling and clicking buttons works great for the games that need it.

As with every mouse make sure it fits your hand. I feel I can put my palm into if I want or just basically finger touch it and the control and ease with how this mouse glides makes mousing fun again (I have been using some dimestore version for the past 10 days). They have a nice supplement of weights if you choose to lower what they have at the factory. I don't mind it right out of the box. Others will want to take a weight or two out.

The roller is also topnotch here and has a metal and rubber design. Still working great after a year of solid work. The materials have held fairly well over this time and I am completely satisfied with the mouse. All in all a homerun for the M45.",5.0,B00CXI0BPG,Great mouse with a couple caveats.,Video Games

"I liked the different character classes and the visuals. It was fun to play. Don't be mislead by some bad PC reviews, the games are not exactly the same. I liked how they restricted you to 6 skills that can be keyed, rather than making you pull up a selection wheel. It is a fairly easy game, even on night mare, unless you increase the difficulty. I also liked the no real money auction.

I didn't like that they made X the trigger for main attack instead of R1. WHY WHY  WHY? You can't change that until you are level 19. I also didn't like the aiming system for ranged characters. They made the R joystick an evade option (roll, I rarely used it) so there isn't any aim or look function. You aim by moving your body and it is awkward. The characters are very small and the aim is very touchy. After that an auto system kicks in for a group, but an enemy was often on me before I had it targeted.

The PC version gives you bonuses for playing on a harder difficulty, but not the console versions, I wonder why not.

"I've been using this mouse for about week now and it's awesome. I previously owned a Razer Naga Molten edition and it worked great except it didn't have mechanical buttons, so your thumb would get fatigued after an hour of gaming. I also tried out the new Razer Naga 2014 and I really wanted to like that mouse but it ended up being a little to big for my hands. So I gave the Naga5 Hex a try since it was the only other Naga left that I haven't tried yet.

The Naga Hex has 6 mechanical buttons that are located at good locations for your thumb to reach once you get use to the circular setup. Button 4 and 5 will take some practice to get use to but once you do it's second nature. I like how big the buttons are as well it makes it much easier to hit during the heat of battle especially playing fast paced games like ARPG's.
I mainly play Diablo 3 and Path of Exile but I have tried it with Guild Wars 2 as well and it works great; you'll just have to use the Shift or Alt keys as alternative for buttons 1-6. I even tried it with Left 4 Dead 2 and didn't have any issues.

Overall, I highly recommend this mouse if you are into ARPG/Moba type or any other games could use the extra buttons.",5.0,B006W3ZXEW,My Go to Mouse Now!,Video Games

"As far as first person shooters go, it is hard to imagine one as good as F.E.A.R.  The gameplay, graphics, and story are among the best in the genre, in my opinion.

What sets this game apart, however, is the overwhelming sense of dread it instills in you pretty much from the onset of the game.  The anticipation of something utterly creepy around every corner is as much an ""enemy"" as any of the numerous Replica soldiers encountered throughout the game; in some ways, it is even worse.  The horror aspect of F.E.A.R. is well done and, even better, tightly-woven into the plot of the game, not merely tacked on for its own sake.  Also, the way the story is presented--through voice mail, data on laptops, and dreamlike visions your character has periodically--allow it to unfold in a way that seems natural and unforced.

The weapons are pretty much standard for the genre, my favorite (by far) being the Particle weapon--one shot kills and what it does to human targets the reasons.  But the real skill weapons are the various grenades and mines you have at your disposal.  Blowing up enemies with a well-placed proximity mine is more satisfying than unloading a full clip from a machine gun into them (although this is pretty satisfying too).

Perhaps it is my style of play, but I found the melee and slow motion features to be pretty much useless.  Since most enemies know you are there almost immediately upon entering a room (stealth is not a strong component of this game) you are rarely in melee range.  And I cannot think of a single encounter that necessitated the use of slow motion, and quite frankly, I forgot it was available most of the time.

But combat is exciting and certain situations are downright memorable.  Using cover and leaning out to get a few shots off are essential against the good enemy AI--they will attempt to keep you stationary with suppression fire while a member of the squad flanks you; flush you out with a grenade; and call for backup when needed.  Some fights are indeed a challenge, but never to the point of frustration.

As has been stated a million times, the graphics are superb.  Through the amount of detail in every area--from trash strewn about to various items on desks to lights blinking on computer and lab equipment--the designers have certainly done a great job of creating a believable, realistic game world.  More variety in environments would have been nice, but what has been provided is excellent quality.  I am fortunate to have a video card that allows me to play the game with all settings maxed and get a good frame rate; the result is a world that had me as immersed as any since Far Cry (the only thing that shattered the illusion was the fan on my video card as it throttled up repeatedly while playing ;-))

Perhaps for all of its good points, the game seems a bit too short.  I bought it on a Saturday and completed it on Medium difficulty on Monday, and this was with moderate playing, never more than an hour or so at one sitting.  I promptly played through single player again, paying more attention to the small details and enjoyed it as much the second time.  That said, there is not much more I can get out of the game since multiplayer FPS doesn't interest me.

So, for a brief, intense space of time F.E.A.R. will draw you into its world, hold you there, and then breathlessly spit you out.  Defintely worth playing but it will leave you wanting more.",4.0,B0000ZUGZ4,"Chilling, atmospheric game but a short-lived experience",Video Games

She likes all the games and technique sections that teach her how to do different things other than just strumming all 6 strings wildly  :)

The amp section is pretty fun to.....all I ever had was my little practice amp so its kinda neat to hear how different setups sound.

Its true this doesn't teach a lot of theory or the why you play this or that, but its a game and it should be fun, so I get that.

"This is my first experience with EA Sports' Madden football on Xbox and I must say I'm hooked!  I find that after about 4 months of playing the game I  play the Ultimate Team most often and have enjoyed building my team via the auctions. I also enjoy playing Draft Team for a different gameplay experience.

Open Practice, Solo Challenges (where you pick up coins if you win...) and Skills Trainers are essential for new players to gain both insights into the game and to build their gaming skills in Madden 17.  The ability to go head-to-head with other players online is fun IF you get an opponent who doesn't pause gameplay all the time and you both have a solid internet connection. I have not played Franchise mode.

Visually this game is very good (Madden 18 is better).  Sometimes during gameplay, I've encountered a few glitches with the downloaded game (not the disc) whereby things get 'stuck'.  With both the disc and downloaded versions it's not uncommon for players to walk through each other following a play.  Odd, since during the down they were crashing into one another.  It's not a big deal, but noticeable.

Gameplay is fun and once you get the basics there's still a lot you can learn to improve and enhance it.  YouTube has a lot of videos related to playbooks used in Madden 17 that are worth a look, and MutHead forums and comparisons (for players) are also helpful.

While the game is not 'perfect' it's definitely fun and one of my favorites for Xbox. Despite having it be the year 17 version, I think it's better than 18 and you might be able to pick it up for about twelve bucks like I did.",4.0,B01F84ZRSW,Playin' it every day,Video Games

"Other reviewers have described the premise, so I won't repeat it. The game is a multi-stage puzzle - a series of little shockwave games - some verbal, some visual, some involving a certain amount of dexterity (not a lot, fortunately). The games are infuriating at times, but given that their author is supposed to be a serial killer, one must make allowances.

The idea of searching the web for clues, and receiving emails from other 'participants' is quite innovative, and adds to the immersion. Since the game has been published in Europe for some time, though, the searches also uncover walkthroughs. Bit of a temptation, that.

The production values are excellent - the video sections are slick, with lots of very photogenic European locations, the acting is good, and the overall design is spot on. the story is compelling and the characters are sympathetic.

For the most part, I enjoyed this game.

So why the 2-star rating? Some annoying technical issues and a lousy ending.

First, the technical issues:

-  When you first play the game, you have to log on,  using a user name you created yourself plus a password assigned by the game. Better write this on a piece of paper because you'll need it every time you play. Don't these people know about cookies?

-  You can't save the game - it decides on the restart point. It isn't always where you would like to restart.

-  The game is supposed to integrate with your email client. Mine didn't - I use Eudora, and it fixated on Outlook Express(which then tried to take over, the way it does). I had to work around this by loading my email client before running the game. This is important because emails often contain clues.

-  The game was a CPU hog. When it was running, other applications didn't get a look in. Since the whole point of the game is that it coexists with a web browser and email client, this isn't good. A workaround is to use the XP task manager to drop the priority of the task 'missing.exe'. Maybe it's part of the game:).

And as for the ending......(No spoilers, don't worry). Imagine that you've spent several hours working towards the denouement. At the very last minute, the screen goes blank and your only way of finding out what is going on is to wait for emails from the eye witnesses. These come in over a period of time. It's either designed to heighten suspense or the developers ran out of money.

It's a shame how this game turned out: at the beginning, I really liked it.

Oh well.

Granted, Seattle looks absolutely gorgeous. Flying around the city admiring the structures and pummeling foes is fun in short bursts. Once you begin to realize how lifeless the city is, the immersion is lost for good.

In a game like this where neither the atmosphere nor gameplay succeed story becomes incredibly important. Unfortunately, what's here is forgettable.

As negative as my review is, I still feel that inFamous: Second Son is worth it to the right person. If you happened to enjoy inFamous 2, you will very likely enjoy this latest iteration. It suffers from the same issues, but manages to deliver a better visual experience.

"Better than the original Playstation version by a huge margin.  The graphics are incredible, and the gameplay has been better balanced because I know from the original PSX version I sunk in well over 100+ hours back in the day between school winter break and summer vacation.  The grinding for classes was brutal, repetitive and monotonous, that has been mitigated somewhat in this re-release by the fact that it's portable and much easier to pick up, do some grinding and easily put it to sleep.  Still, as far as Dragon Quests go, this one definitely is stretched out gameplay wise by the class system more than any of the others.  Good for completion-ists, but if you just want to go through the game, enjoy the story and some fun tactics then you can skip much of the class grinding and save yourself probably a good couple days worth of hours doing battles.",5.0,B017W175SE,The definitive version.,Video Games

"Forget references to Baldur's Gate and go back further.  Think Phantasie.  Or Ultima III on the Commodore 64.  But in a good way.

This expansion of NWN2 takes a game that was ""cinematic"" in look and feel along the lines of KoTOR or Mass Effect, and brings it back to old CRPG roots of random encounters and more generic towns.  And I say old CRPG because old pen & paper RPGs rarely let a single player control 5 entirely self-created characters by himself.  Even games like Baldur's Gate (or later Ultimas) had the pre-created characters with their built-in personalities.

Very old-school CRPGs on early 1980's computers let you create a full roster of characters of your own liking without imposing pre-created characters (like Minsc or Khelgar) onto you.  And in this way, Storm of Zehir is very much like those old CRPGs in a way I've missed in most games aside from Spiderweb Software type titles.

I can see how SoZ would be the perfect platform for making original content creation much easier, as it was with the original Neverwinter Nights.

The problem with NWN2 in the past was that there were so many classes and prestige classes that you could never take advantage of unless you were to play the game all over again.  With SoZ I was able to shoot for many different prestige classes all within my generic party.

The trade system adds new flavor that builds on the Knight Commander's ""mini game"" at Crossroads Keep from the original, but I'm not sure how well it would translate to use in other fan-created content, and it can be a tad annoying at times to run across the map avoiding deadly encounters and not get one bar of ore needed to complete a quest plot line.

On the down side, the Inns are a little TOO generic, and does every town need a Temple of Waukeen?  Aren't there several dozen deities to choose from in the Forgotten Realms setting?

I would have preferred it if the Inns and Temples at least had a few more original personalities in each to talk to.  Even the old Ultima III game of the early 80's had unique taverns in each town.  Which is why I mention ""Phantasie"" --- in many ways Storm of Zehir is like a return to that sort of gaming.

This will appeal to people who love playing D&D just to mess around with  stats and build great characters -- and for those who realize that ""role playing"" is often secondary to enjoying the mechanics and strategy of role playing games, or at least does not need to be limited to a single character and ample cut-scenes.",4.0,B001E3ARJ6,"A different sort of game altogether, appealing to old-school CRPG fans",Video Games

"I've been a LONG TIME Mario Kart fan since SNES - and this installment is a very worthy entry -

One of my favorite features is that you can unlock the ability to race as one of your Mii characters!! It's about darn time Nintendo!! The Mii feature is a very fun aspect of the Wii, but has been completely underutilized - so I was quite pleased by this addition.

Another great feature is the ONLINE PLAY - while the loading time can feel like forever (and they need to work out the friend kinks, as it took my friend and I THREE DAYS to network together) this is a very exciting feature. Being able to race strangers worldwide is very exciting - but I do wish there was an option to invite players you race randomly, but have fun racing with, into your ""Friends"" network.

One poor feature for me and my friends is the Wii Wheel - The Wheel is VERY hard to control, it works, and I imagine it'd be fun for casual gamers - but to really race some of the harder legs, its too unreliable. The remote and nunchuck are surely the way to play this title.

The unlockable characters, karts and motorcycles are great - but I do wish they could have fit in a few more  levels. The retro-levels are awesome, more please! Same with the weapons, the new ones are fun, but they surely could have included a few more.

"Greetings all.

I purchased 'Fate: Jewel Case edition' believing I was purchasing Fate, Fate 2 (Undiscovered Reality) and Fate 3 (The Traitor Soul).  It arrived on time and in good condition.

I'm running the game on Windows 7.  When I attempted to load and install the game my computer had a difficult time reading the disk.  I eventually needed to resort to opening the game manually through Windows Explorer.  Although the load was very slow, the game loaded successfully.

At first look after installation it appeared I only had access to Fate 3 (The Traitor Soul).  I became a touch irritated.  Through the search process of looking for the first two Fate games I loaded a game storage site called ""Wild Tangent,"" a site where an individual can pay and play older games.  Fate was there as was Fate 2 (Undiscovered Reality) however, there was a charge to play either of the games, which between the two would have cost more than double what I paid for the Jewel Case edition of Fate.  Now I am more than irritated.  I figure its time to send a very nasty note to the folks I purchased the game from and I headed back to Amazon to let them know my feelings in very clear and concise words.  Luckily for me, I didn't get that far.

I choose to read through the reviews before giving in to my injured sense of fairness in the market place.  First I read all the reviews of those who rated the game a 1.  With a couple of exceptions in which the reviewer just wanted to hear him/herself rant, the reviewers experienced the same issue I did.  I was feeling proud of myself now knowing I wasn't alone.  However, there was a slight dent in my personal feelings of belonging to a disgruntled crowd. . . There were a whole lot more folks who rated the game 5 stars.  Why that was, I decided I needed to find out.

The first Five Star rating I read was written by Oddlydrawn.  He explained how Fate 3 (The Traitor Soul) contains within itself the other two games, as Fate 2 and 3 were expansions to the original Fate.

So good reader--if you have not read Oddlydrawn's review I believe you will find it very helpful and then, perhaps, like me, you will begin to feel the world isn't as bad as it was half an hour ago.  :-)

"I will start by saying the Whisper Fan is made for the launch model of Xboxs only. I have the Resident Evil 5 Edition Xbox 360 and It doesn't sit perfectly because its OEM fan is about 15% slimmer. It still sits pretty firm just not flat. Because of that, it is a little bit noisier than the original. I still love it.

"I just recently purchased and started playing this game.  I assume that it's because of when it came out that people have spotted comparisons and, mostly, contrasts between it and Oblivion.  Nowadays, no one would probably put the 2 together at all, other than the magic and swords and first-person perspective.  The gameplay and appearance remind me more of Dishonored, minus a lot of the cool stuff like upgrades and dual-wield.  I bet that if it was made in the last few years, it'd have all of that.  The controls are a bit stiff and I don't like being forced to only use weapons and/or magic from one specific class but that doesn't kill the fun.  The story is ok and the voice acting was done well enough.  You have a decent submenu to choose weapons, armor, and spells from but it's not extensive like in an RPG.  Also, you get XP from killing enemies which levels you up and gains you bonus attributes but they are all predetermined.  It seems like the developers tried to make everything pretty simple.  Just a few additions and tweeks and this game could've had a lot more depth and replay value.  Overall, if you can get it for under $20, it's worth a playthrough.  Especially if you're looking for a few games to hold you over until you get an Xbox One.",4.0,B000MTF054,Slightly dated but fun,Video Games
"The sheer, overwhelming popularity of ""Assassin's Creed II"" is what finally compelled me to buy it. Coming into it, having seen gameplay clips and much praise about ""how much better than ACI it [was]"", I expected something at least average. Unfortunately, I have been spoiled by the ease-of-use offered by the control schemes of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Infamous/dp/B000ZK7ZOE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Infamous</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ratchet-Clank-Future-A-Crack-in-Time/dp/B00275A7LI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ratchet & Clank Future: A Crack in Time</a>&nbsp;and even&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Prototype/dp/B000WQWPP0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Prototype</a>. Honestly, the controls are a mess, but the experience is well-done.

1. SOUND. Undoubtedly one of the most immersive and atmospheric games on the market. The background voices of the crowds, the shopkeepers calling out their wares, the heralds, the doctors, people commenting on your climbing abilities... It all adds up to make for a realistic experience, smoothed out by a breathtaking, Hollywood-quality musical score. Standout tracks include ""Ezio's Family"", ""Earth"", and ""Venice Rooftops"", all of which lovingly combine modern-sounding synthetic rhythms with ageless symphonic, both ethereal and beautiful. (5/5)

2. GRAPHICS. The textures on characters are nearly flawless, the amount of detail in the world around the player is amazing, and the contrast of light and shadow is nicely done. The day-to-night and vice versa transitions are also wonderfully done. The performance capture on the characters is fantastic, and the facial animations rarely venture into the ""uncanny valley"". Still, it's very obvious that the game uses ""ragdoll"" physics rather than some of the higher-end and more realistic physics engines. I still have trouble believing that the game uses the Havok engine. (3/5)

3. LENGTH AND SIZE. With Venice being the largest of them all, the different locations are immersive, wonderfully rendered, highly realistic, and a lot of fun to play around in. Though the game itself is somewhat short, with Sequences 12 and 13 only being available as downloadable content (there are no Trophies for these, so it's still possible to get every trophy without downloading them), and the framing story being a bit uninteresting, the amount of side-missions and treasure-hunting to do around in each of the worlds is enough to keep oneself busy for days or weeks at a time. From the marshes to the mountains to the cathedral in Rome, the sheer size and historical value of the game is sure to entertain and amaze. (3/5)

4. NARRATIVE. Personally, I didn't enjoy the framing narrative of the Pieces of Eden (as I feel the 2012 conspiracy has been much overdone), but the narrative within Ezio's story itself is intriguing. From Leonardo da Vinci to Machiavelli himself, there are so many characters - both real and original - to flesh out the game and make it feel like it really took place. Overall, the internal story is very well-done and engaging, and despite the framing narrative, the ending sequence was quite interesting - and a little bit creepy, not to mention that I found it vaguely offensive in spite of the disclaimer shown at the beginning of each gaming session. (4/5)

5. CONTROLS. The controls take some getting used to, and even after getting used to them, are still rather broken. The context commands are difficult, and the parkour movements are so clumsy it makes one want to crush the controller in sheer frustration. Hopping from point to point is a nightmare, as sometimes Ezio will plunge off a roof for no apparent reason. Climbing is at first a nightmare as well, as often Ezio tends to jump off entirely, sometimes to his death. Context commands outside of combat are okay, but in combat, the motion-captured movements are so clumsy and slow that it makes you glad the enemies are incapable of moving any faster than you. The lack of Sixaxis support for Leonardo's flying machine is blatantly obvious and would have likely made the sequence (sequences, if you download Sequence 12) easier for the PS3 version. The camera is also rather awful, and all these combine to make for a somewhat nauseating experience. (1/5)

6. CINEMATIC EXPERIENCE. Being interrupted, at least early in the game, every two to three minutes by a cutscene that cannot be skipped just serves to make the game less enjoyable. There's no doubt that the motion capture done on the characters is very well done, but instead of integrating the story into the game, the game is integrated into the story. In other words, this plays like a very well-done but rather clumsy big-budget Hollywood blockbuster. At times, it feels as though it would have been better off as a film. (2/5)

OVERALL: the controls are broken regardless of one's skill with them. However, the rest of the game is well done and, for the most part, nicely enjoyable. Total Score: (18/30)",3.0,B00269DX5W,A steep learning curve with rewarding gameplay,Video Games

"Startropics, for those unfamiliar with this great game, is pretty much of the linear RPG type with some challenging puzzles thrown in the mix. You are Mike, who has just arrived at Coralcola to visit your uncle, Dr. J. You find out that he has been kidnapped and only you can save him.

Mike goes through the game equipped with a yo-yo. It proves to be a powerful tool, and it only gets stronger further into the game. You will most likely encounter some frustrating puzzles that seemingly have no solution, but have patience with this game. It is worth it when you figure it out. You will be tasked with conquering undergroung tunnels full of monsters, a haunted graveyard and more. Overall there is enough to do to take many hours away from your life.

This is my personal favorite NES game of all time, along with Mike Tyson's Punch-Out, and if I could rate it higher than 5 stars I would.

"11/10/15 Update: So between my friend and I, we had 3 faulty Xbones out of 5. My first Xbox was D.O.A. My friend had two in a row that were D.O.A. And Microsoft said this was a very rare incident. Ha. My Xbox is a paperweight. Aside from Deadrising 3, the Xbox exclusive games are a joke. Rome- joke. Master chief- joke. Halo 5 was not only a joke, but also a major disappointment. Microtransactions and no split screen?!?! So to play co op someone needs to go buy a second system and gold memebership. GREED! Now Microsoft had to make Tomb Raider a xbox One timed exclusive. This is the only reason i might keep this P.O.S. Also, why do I still need to wire a chat cable to my controller. I have $300 Steel series that work flawlessly with the Ps4 and are completely wireless. But I still need a damn wire for the Xbone. I feel better now.

What a pathetic disappointment. I was one of the fortunate customers that got a dead on arrival system. I purchased the most expensive bundle from a different gaming website than amazon. Paid for 1 day shipping and got it 6 days later. I set it all up, downloaded the update which took over an hour and then unwrapped my first game. I had read reviews about faulty disc drives and hoped this wouldn't be my fate. I go to put the disc in only to hear a heart wrenching grinding noise and the disc would not even go in all the way.

"FF8 has the unfortunate curse of being the next in line after FF7.  That means it had a lot of hype to live up to.  I suspect that's why some people will hate this game-- it just isn't FF7.  However, even though this game isn't FF7, it's an extremely good RPG that stands on its own merits.  It's one of my favorite games of all time (just as good as FF7, although my absolute favorite game is FF9).  Well, let's jump right into the review!

Graphics (score 10/10): The graphics were superb when this game came out, and are still excellent, in my opinion.  I still find them pleasing to the eye.  Of course, I'm not nearly as picky as some people, and obviously, I recognize that it's graphics are older now, but they were magnificent for their time.

Music (score 10/10): Wow.  When I first heard the opening song (Liberi Fatali), I was blown away.  The rest of the game's music doesn't dissapoint either.  Be it exciting songs or mellow tunes, FF8 delivers.  I actually went and bought the soundtrack, which I still listen to, to this day.

Characters (score 10/10): Who doesn't love Squall? He's quite likeable in a grumpy anti-social sort of way....  Plus he's an excellent case study in avoidant-attachment disorder.  Ha ha... Seriously, though, the characters are very well-developed.  I love having unique introspection into the psyche of a main character.  The rest of the characters are excellent, too.  Everyone has a distinctive personality and a role to play in the story; no one feels like they were tacked on at the last minute just to increase the party size (a problem with some other RPGs I've played; I'm looking at you, FF12!).  The characters are portrayed very well and you will become attached to them very quickly.

Story (score 10/10): The story, too, is excellent.  I was thoroughly engaged by it; it has just the right balance of character development and intriguing plot points to keep you entertained. I've played this game at least six times now over the years and I'm still not sick of it.

Battle System (score 9/10): Combat is turn-based like most Final Fantasies.  You draw magic out of enemies to cast directly on enemies, or to equip as stat buffers.  It's fairly easy to learn this system. However, drawing magic over and over again and re-equiping it constantly (and also re-equiping GFs) can get rather tedious; that's what knocks the point off the score.  Other than that, the battle system is fine.  I especially like the ability to pull the trigger on the gunblade using the R1 button; it adds a level of fun interactiveness to the battles.

Gameplay (score 10/10): This is a bit of a catch-all category for me.  Let's see, the first thing of note that comes to mind is the fact that enemies level up at the same rate as Squall.  That means that power-leveling is no longer desirable.  This might be disappointing to some, but I found it to be quite nice because the game isn't overly hard, and I didn't have to waste time power-leveling.  Another point of interest is that you eventually get a way to avoid random battles, which is awesome.  Another point is that there are plenty of mini-games and side-quests of sufficient variety available to enjoy (my favorite is the card game).  So, there should be plenty features here to please everyone.

Overall (score 10/10): NOTE this score is not an average, it's my subjective overall score.  I might have given this game a ""8"" instead of a ""10"" if I had reviewed it when I first bought it, but now that I've played so many different RPGs over the years I realize what a treasure I really have in FF8.  This game really is awesome and I recommend it to all fans of RPGs.",5.0,B0000296O5,This is one of my favorite RPGs...,Video Games
"This game is great, but timing is everyting. I've always loved sonic and I still do. The only problem is control. When sonic glydes after a jump and plans for a homeing attack you can't really control when you want to attack the target. If the target is blowing fire you really have to time your jump perfectly and flawlessly.

I also wish there was someone to see what's about to occur, like if a pillar is going to fall you won't know. You just have to avoid it by jumping or stopping and speeding up again. You can't tell when something is about to intterrupt your progress.

This is it - this is the crowing achievement of the franchise to me.  When I think Zelda, I think Link to the Past.

Great controls, great graphics for the era, the story was exactly what it needed to be to make the game happen.  Great balance, nothing too hard to figure out on your own, but not so simple it feels like a kids game.  Lots of little things here and there, optional items you can get or skip.

The Gameboy Advanced version is all but an exact copy of the SNES version.  It's just as good.  The controls had to be adapted slightly to account for the lack of X and Y buttons, but a good job was done and you'll be adjusted to the new layout in no time.

"WARNING: There is NO online multiplayer for this game!

Essentially what you are buying is an updated version of the original game with better graphics - nothing more. The online multiplayer utilizes the ""Halo: Reach"" engine, but includes maps from ""Halo: CE"".

Their excuses for this:

1) ""We didn't want to split up the reach community!""
Bizarre logic. Should we expect that for H4? Sorry guys, no H4 multiplayer - wouldn't want to split up the Reach community! Just imagine if COD used that logic. You buy Modern Warfare 3, only to find out that online multiplayer is Black Ops. What brilliance! Point being, everyone wanted online multiplayer for CE. Even the people that criticize us for being pissed off admit they would of liked to have seen multiplayer for CE.

2) ""We would have had to ship on 2 discs!""
Would you buy a 2 disc game for the ability to play online multiplayer? There's your answer to this excuse.

Answers to people criticizing my review:

1) ""You should have read the box!""
A) It's not a box, it's a case.
B) This is Amazon.com - not Wal-Mart. There is no ""box"" to look at. Nowhere in this page's product description does it say it utilizes the Halo: Reach engine.
C) I didn't buy the game, knowing months before that it didn't include online multiplayer. I created a petition on Change as well as the Waypoint forums to bring multiplayer back. I don't know why you genius's assume because I'm complaining about there not being multiplayer, that apparently means I thought there was. I want multiplayer on the game whether or not I thought it was going to have it or not - duh!
D) Go heckle people walking out of Target and Wal-Mart. Go chill inside of Gamestop and right after someone buys the game you can start yelling ""SHOULDA READ THE BOX, DERRR"". Who does that anyways? Is it common for games that have the xbox live strip, to be a different xbox live game? Besides ODST, this is the only game I know of that utilizes a completely different game's online portion. Do you really expect people to go on a treasure hunt on the back of the box to question what should already be assumed?

2) ""They released this game and you can't be grateful for what you get?""

"I have followed the Rainbow Six series from the very first version for the PC.  Before, it was the most realistic shooter with great pre-mission planning.  This was a ""sim"" on how counter-terror guys really operate.

Sadly, the Rainbow Six series deviated from it's roots and evolved (or should I say ""devolved"" if there's such a term) into a generic shooter with minimal squad commands.

Good points:

Nice graphics and enviromnental effects.

A lot of enemies to shoot at that shoot back.

More action packed levels instead of stealth based (infact, your guns don't sport silencers anymore).

Cinematic movies.

Bad points:

Goggle view is lame and unrealistic.

Your characters don't wear masks and helmets (Real counter-terror operatives use masks)

No more pre-mission planning (same comment with Rainbow Six 3)

No recognizable differences among firearms (just the difference in sighting mechanism).

Bottomline:

For people looking for realistic counter-terror ops, this is not the game for you.  But for people looking for fun action shooters, this game is good enough.

"I feel that I should write a review on this due to the other review posted that was negative.  1st off the card works great, the card doesn't offer a full 64gb of memory but it does give 59gb.  I ordered this from japan and it arrived shortly and works great on the American vita models, it has all of the space I need and more.

In reference to the other person who feels that the card costs as much as the system, someone probably ordered a few and is raising the price by a large margin.  These cards will only cost about $100 when they are released in the USA, the one card available through amazon prime is setting prices that are unreasonable, $175 is far too much however I was able to get one for $125 through Hananoiro Shop.

If you need the space then I would say to get this card, if anyone has any questions please feel free to ask.

P.S.  I've noticed that a lot of people have been giving this product negative reviews, I wanted to just tell people that these guys aren't upset because the product is faulty or defective but they gave it poor reviews because they are unhappy with the price.

Update 3-18-2014 Ive already filled up my card and ill be buying a second one, I still recommend this product greatly and I wanted to inform people that certain games will take up a lot of space like the release of Final Fantasy X for the PS Vita which takes up a whopping 6.6GB, I do agree its overpriced but I need another one and Im just grateful that they make a card this big since the original PSP maxed out at 32GB, hopefully in the future they release an even bigger card around 128GB but im fairly certain for this format that they won't and if they did it would be over $200 easy

"When DOOM came out 1993, it shook the gaming world to its knees. No one has seen anything like it and visually, was an improvement to id Software's widely successful Wolfenstein 3D. DOOM also generated controversy along with Mortal Kombat for having over the top violence and high levels of blood and gore. So naturally it was a hit with gamers. Fast forward 9-10 months later, DOOM II came out, still retaining the high amounts of violence and gore became just as big if not bigger. So when Sony came out with Playstation in 1995, of course they wanted a home version of this widely popular first person shooter. And it doesn't disappoint. DOOM for the Playstation has both DOOM (more specially, the Ultimate DOOM which id Software released in 1995. Basically DOOM with an added fourth episode) and DOOM II in one disc making one giant game. The gameplay is simple but extremely addicting which makes DOOM a blast to play. A large arsenal of weapons ranging from a pistol, to a shotgun, a plasma gun, heck even a chainsaw to name a few. It's a little primitive, you can't look up, down, or even jump but with the way the levels are designed, you don't need to. Enemies come from undead possessed soldiers and demons big and small with epic boss battles not to mention cool power ups. If you have still have a PS1 lying and want some good first shooters I recommend this and the just as good Final DOOM.

"""Super Mario Galaxy"" is an amazing game! My kids (son 12 & daughter 16) played this game non-stop for several days right after we bought it, and still play it several times a week.

The game centers around saving Princess Peach from Bowser's evil grip (yet again :-) by hopping, jumping, flying, skating, using fireballs, etc, to clear over 100 great, but somewhat challenging levels.

The controls are hard for younger players to master, but come fairly quickly to teens and adults.

"I was a little concerned about trying this because I had many other games I wanted to try with my PS4.  But I gave it a shot anyways.  Man, there is actually a story-plot to this game!  Finally, not just a ""get in a car, drive it around and hit stuff"" type of game.  Sure you don't really have to pay any attention to any of that story either, but I have liked going through it.  Being able to chose between a racer and a cop is pretty nice also.

The soundtrack is great also, and there are tons of different artist and styles, but I hate there is not a way to listen to what you WANT to listen to when you are being chased by a cop...

"The original fear suffered from repetition of environments and gameplay but was well crafted enough to stay engaging and challenging. Thanks to bland textures and level design, this looks worse than the already aging original and sometimes reminds me of the cityscapes featured in Duke3d. Despite playing on the hardest difficulty, I feel less challenge and less need for strategy than the first.

"This is it, race fans - the finest racing game yet available.  Nearly photorealistic visuals, stunning attention to real-world physics, and the feel of good old knock-down, drag-out racing.  You can't get any better than this.
Single players can play arcade style races or enter simulation mode to compete on multiple-race circuits; there are different car classes, unlimited qualifying, and money to buy cars, parts, and other trinkets.  Learning the tracks and your car is essential to successful driving; the manual comes with a few pages from the Skip Barber manual that will give you the basics.
You'll grit your teeth in frustration trying to beat a souped-up Daihatsu wagon in your stock Miata at the lower-echelon levels; and your brain will explode trying to pilot a Dodge Viper-based racecar around a track at speeds exceeding 150 miles per hour.  Every aspect of the experience is realistic and adjustable, from tire camber to gear ratios; sound is awesome; and there are hundreds of cars to choose from.  Music selection is a little sparse.
Multiple players can compete on 1 screen, or the iLink cables and hub can be used to link up to 4 racers (requiring a PS2 and a TV for each of them.)
I've never played a driving game this good - and i've played 'em all, starting with Turbo in the local pizza parlor at age 11 (did I just date myself?), to Pole Position, Hard Drivin', Cruisin', Vette, Crazy Taxi, Midnight Club Street Racing, the list goes on.

"I really have to hand it to Capcom for making teamwork the cornerstone of gameplay. In every room that you reach, this game hammers home the message that you have to stick together and work as a group. When jumping from one rooftop to another, you may misjudge the distance and fall short. Thankfully, a teammate can pull you up.

Even before the game commences, you'll find yourself coordinating tactics with your soon-to-be companions at the character selection screen. In a similar vein to an RPG, each of the eight playable characters that you can select brings completely different abilities to the table that you must factor in. Do you bring a lock-picker? Someone with extra inventory spots? Or rely on firepower with a weapons expert?

Unlike the other games in the series, zombies can pass from room to room and are often found in packs. Taking this newfound hunting prowess into account, Capcom has implemented a handful of new techniques that players can use to survive. You can slide under beds, hide in lockers, and even repel a zombie attack by forcing their head away from your neck with enough breathing room to raise your pistol and shoot them directly between the eyes. You'll even find strategy in the reloading of weapons. For instance, a box of shells takes more time to load than a clip. As annoying as it is to watch your character get munched because he couldn't load the rounds quick enough, I really like this aspect. It makes you keep an eye on every little detail.

Where Outbreak excels in engrossing multiplayer and creative gameplay, the overall design of the game is very odd. Rather than creating one lengthy quest that players can really sink their teeth into, Capcom opted to break up the game into five separate scenarios that are roughly 45 minutes each. If you die, you'll turn into a zombie for a brief extent (and yes, you can attack your teammates if you like), then will be dropped out of the game. Sadly, you can't re-spawn. You either have to wait for your friends to finish up, or find another game to enter. While scripted controller commands are offered, it doesn't support voice chat at all or keyboard functionality in-game. Someone's head should roll for this!",3.0,B0000TSRA6,cant take controls and bad without online,Video Games

"There's no cutscene skip. One would think that Square Enix would include this feature since this game is over 10 years old and the large majority of people buying this game have already played it. Not only that, but there are scenes that can't advance more quickly by mashing X that you otherwise could have in the original version. The first clear example being during a scene at the entrance to Kilika Temple (within the first few hours of the game) with the Luca Goers.

Why is this a big deal for me? It's a JRPG. The story in X is pretty good, but it's not stellar. I mostly play games for their battle system, not the story. It would be nice to be able to skip at least some of the cutscenes, even just the ones that are FMVs. Plus, I would have liked to attempt to speed run the game, but with cutscenes, the best times on the PS2 barely cut 11 hours. An extra hour is added on this version for seemingly longer load times and previously partially-skippable scenes. Such a shame.

Well, now that I'm off my soapbox, I'll say some positive things. The updated graphics look really great, and it's good that they added in the international version, which was previously unavailable in the US. I'm excited to try the new sphere grid.

"I played this game over and over because it became so addictive that i started to actually have nightmares about it and hell i'm 29 years old. I've also been an avid gamer since atari came out in the early 80's and i must admit things have gotten 10000 times more advanced than ever before. My problem is that its getting old, the publicizing of violence runs rapid throughout the world and we sit and entertain ourselves with it like its second nature. I got rid of this game twice because of the problems that its FUN started to cause me. When doom first hit the shelves in like 91 i thought wow this is great because it ""looked"" like a game, not the real dead. So as i see the future of gaming with the new PS3 and XBOX 360 on the horizon there are no suitable games for anyone younger than 17, every preview i've seen is war, fighting, killing and bloodbathed demons, i'll admit i like these kinds of games(to an extent). I just wish the gaming industry would slack off on these types of games and come up with more creative ideas.

"I am a game lover.  My wife and I play games together constantly.  We are solid gamers, each of us able to polish off most games on the ""normal"" setting pretty easily.  We are not spectacular players, we are not honed machines of video game grace.  But we play for hours every week and have done so for years, so we are not newbies by any stretch of the imagination; please take my complaints about this game with that in mind--if you are a polished videogame diety, then you will have less trouble than we did.  If you are a newbie, well then, pay extra attention--this game's fun quotient (which is very high at times) is seriously hampered by its bizarre controls and frustrating requirements.

This is a visually arresting game--the style is clean and modern, beautiful to look at.  It is as if the entire city agreed to a limited but brilliant palette, and keeps everything really clean.  The buildings are interesting to look at, and the places that you play through are full of fun things to jump on and over.  My wife and I are fascinated by parkour in real life, so finding a beautiful looking game that focuses on parkour made us really happy at first.  We also like the style of animation--very Adult Swim cool.  We were a little confused as to why the game animation style varies so greatly from the story animation, but overall that is not a big deal.  Both are fun to watch, and the animation is great both directions.  The story line is interesting and keeps you moving, even when you are contemplating pulling the disc out of your PS3 and lighitng it on fire.  Or kicking the game designers in their collective shins.

So yea, first person parkour was way cool.  At first.  Then the frustration began.  This game is essentially a platformer (our favorite type of game, we usually rock at these games) with first person moves.  And in all fairness, when things flow, it is really fun.  Not quite as fun as moving through the streets for the first time was in Assassin's creed, but close to that fun.  You jump from obstacle to obstacle, under pipes, over huge gaps in buildings...breathtaking.  The downside is you can't see all the cool moves you are getting to do, and that is kind of a shame.  You have this superbad character you are playing, but you never really get to see her in action.  I'd like to see a replay option in 3rd person as a bonus.

Unfortunately, there are many times when you are under pressure--either someone is shooting you, or for some other reason you have a time issue.  This would not be bad if the game were better at directing you...but it sucks at this.  ""Ah!"" you exclaim, ""but that is the beauty of the game! You must find your own way!"" you say.  Well, that is a legitimate point, within reason.  There have been more than one occasion in which the way forward can only be reached in a single fashion, and the secret is pretty well hidden.  That is fine if you aren't getting shot at...but if you keep dying because a sniper is shooting you and you don't know where to go...and if it happens 10-15 times...and if you keep getting set back in front of a difficult obstacle you have to conquer first, and that also kills you 10-15 times...then somewhere the game designers didn't really think about what they were doing.  Yes, we got past all of them eventually, but the repetition it took us (and we are good gamers, mind you) got really boring and frustrating.  After a while it wasn't fun any more, and when a game becomes not fun, then it makes you wonder why you are playing it.

And while I am on the subject of snipers (and other gun toting baddies in general), whoever designed the combat portion of this game deserves to be taken out back and forced to fight like our heroine.  Guns are few, far between, non-flashy or exciting to use, have no aiming aid (a real bummer), and are essentially temporary--you can't store them on your person.  And guns are the good part--your personal ability to fight is there...she does have some moves (nice spin kick!), but executing them in any reasonable fashion against their bad guys is not easy to do, and you die a lot.  A lot.  A lot.  Once more, frustrating, why am I playing this game?

Also, I have a huge issue with the controls.  Some people have complemented DICE on the controls.  I say that whoever designed the controls for the PS3 needs to have their head examined.  L1 is jump? The single most frequently used button in the game is L1? Really? Oh, and the second most used control is L2? OK, if you are willing to buy into L1 is jump, then L2 as duck makes sense.  But I respectfully suggest that allowing some control re-assignment would be better for those of us who are used to X being jump--because 5000 other games have taught us that x=jump!  And whoever made the virtually useless R1 ""insta-reverse"" should be shot with a water gun full of curdled goat milk.  ""Insta reverse"" is very useful in some jumping situations, but R1 has often been ""Fire!"" or other things in other games, and let me tell you that hitting R1 in a fight can spell your rapid death.  Sounds simple.  But whatever.  In this day and age, there is no excuse for controls that a player doesn't like not being completely reassignable--or at least having alternative control schemes.  Something.  My wife and I both think that this was our number one complaint.

Wow, so after reading that, you must think that there is no reason to play this game at all.  And you would be wrong, because when the frustrating portions of the game are not bothering you, this game is one of fluid grace, of breathtaking running, jumping climbing excitement.  She moves like a dream, when she is allowed to do so, and for those moments when things are going well, it is just magic.  Pure magic.  I loved those portions.

In the end, I would not buy this game again, knowing what I know.  It was tons of fun for a few moments, and then some fun for a lot more moments, but not much fun at all for about half of it.  I would consider buying a sequel if the game designer takes some of these complaints into consideration--and I know that I am not the only one who feels this way--other reviewers on professional sites have had the same complaints about replaying levels over and over again until they get them right.

So how do you know if it is your cup of tea? Rent it!  Check out a demo!  If you dig it, don't hesitate to throw down  the 60 bones for a really unique experience.  But if you have a hard time, then renting is really a better choice.

"Whoa, whoa, whoa, WHOA!!! Three and a half stars?! Okay, now that I just beat this game, I think it's time I give my two cents and lay this shock to rest. Anyway, I think it's time we recall the Paper Mario games before we go straight to this. They are extremely fleshed-out RPGs starring Nintendo's plucky plumber, and they do a great job at breathing new life into the franchise. The stories have been engaging and hilarious, and the atmospheres and battling mechanics are timeless. With that said, Super Paper Mario takes the series to a new direction: Outside the RPG format.

Yep, this is now an action-adventure-platformer-puzzler extravaganza, and with what's arguably the heaviest plot in the series; one day, Mario and Luigi were sitting around at home, when suddenly, Peach gets kidnapped! What I love about this game is that regardless of the story's tone, the writing knows when to time its jokes. In this case, they parody the Peach-kidnapping scenario as if it was the first time (""Why, that's ridiculous! Who in the world would do such a thing?!"" - ""Bro, this must be the work of that guy! That bad guy!""). But after going into Bowser's Castle, it turns out that a mysterious being named Count Bleck was the kidnapper, and he proceeds to not only kidnap Luigi and Bowser, but also sends Mario to a place called Flipside, and has this giant void set up to wipe out all living worlds. Yeah. Things get pretty real at times.

There are some things I have to gripe about, though. Let's start with who Mario encounters during his adventure. The first character that greets Mario is Tippi, a ""Pixl"" who seems to be this game's Goombella/Goombario. She actually serves of greater significance in another portion of the story, but the rest of the Pixls are kinda lame; sure, they are useful as powers, but their personalities are lacking, especially considering each one has only one whacked-out conversation with you the entire game, and say nothing more afterwards. The conversations themselves can be fun(ny), but the personalities mesh together. Speaking of which, I'm not a fan of the art direction, which, while fine in its own right, is mostly rather bland in comparison to the atmospheric environments in the previous Paper Mario games. The NPCs within those places also tend to be forgettable (likely due to how they're designed with basic shapes), but there are very notable some exceptions.

Truth be told, though, that's all I really have against the game. Sure, a couple puzzles may be a little too infuriating for my taste, and there may be more reading than necessary for something that isn't an RPG, but considering the series this game hails from, these cons are minor, if they even are cons. The rest of the game really shines in quality; switching from a 2D perspective to 3D is a genius concept, and this holds true in the execution. Not to mention, turn-based battles have been replaced with good ol' stomping on enemies! When the platforming design is good, it's REALLY good. However, this game doesn't just rely on such.

Many of the game's ""levels"" will put your exploration and puzzle-solving skills to the test. Whether you use Pixls or other characters like Bowser, Peach, or Luigi, they will all carry vital abilities for you to use to figure out how to move on or discover a hidden goody. And like the previous installments, Super Paper Mario does provide clues around the actual puzzles; you mainly just have to figure out where you can find the clue or what the clue is trying to tell you. Let me just say this right now: Folks, if you think you're going to play through THIS Wii game casually, your experience will NOT last for long. This game requires a brain, and you must make sure you have your smarts ready. As well as your sense of humor.

I really can't review a Paper Mario game without commenting on how funny a lot of the jokes are! These come in all sizes, from puns (One world is called ""The Underwhere"") to a freakin' game show about asking random questions to decide who is real and who's an imposter! Heck, one of the villains in the game is a completely relatable exaggeration of an Internet nerd! I mean, seriously...I can't do this game justice when it comes to describing all the little comedic lines and touches spread throughout.

What I can do, though, is finally lay out my overall opinion. Super Paper Mario is admittedly not as fantastic as The Thousand-Year Door was. It didn't have the moments or types of locales that that game had, and a couple things didn't translate as well to the action-platformer-adventure-puzzler Super Paper Mario was trying to be. But despite that, I still believe this game is a meaty, underrated Wii game that seems to be looked at from the wrong expectations. If you love Paper Mario, or are willing to try a new kind of Mario game, this is totally for you.",5.0,B000NNDN1M,A wholly underrated Wii gem!,Video Games
"If you are getting killed by a sniper, get close, take cover and use the knife, or take your sniper rifle and give him a headshot, and other thing in this game, is that you can't only run like RAMBO, you have to fight with your teammates and take the other side of the map if you need to, this is very important, because of the RAMBOS there are a lot of snipers kills and mortar strikes.

I recommend this game, for many aspects, specialty for the sound, graphics and the battlefield action.

This game is different from Call of Duty, so you have to play it different too.

The bad thing for me is that It needs more maps for the multiplayer, I hope they will come soon.",5.0,B000TI836G,MOVEMENT AND STRATEGY GAME!!!,Video Games

"A slightly less impressive port of the original Dreamcast game with some extra features, pretty much sums up the GCN version of Code Veronica X. This is a great game, one of the better Resident Evil\'s in my opinion. Now, if you still have a Dreamcast, you should get it is more impressive visually and the VMU health meter is a nice touch and alternative instead of having to hit pause to check your current condition) Capadded about 5 minutes of cutscenes to this version, but really, if you never see them, you\'re not missing out on much as it\'s basically just a bunch of the cut scenes slightly longer and a more drawn out ending sequence (which actually hinders the moment IMO) So, if you don\'t have a Dreamcast, I\'m sure you can look past the few flaws and enjoy your 5 minutes extra of a great Resident Evil game.

"I started playing this 2 days ago and have around 8 hours in on the PC. I joined Origin's access program in order to play the trial to decide if I wanted to shell out the money for this as it has been a LONG time since I paid full price for a video game.

I will preface this by saying I'm running a custom built computer, 16gb ram, i7-4790, r9 290x video card. I have had no performance issues at all and the game has defaulted everything to Ultra, so it looks great.

As soon as the game loads you are launched into an introduction. This intro is two fold, one it gives you an overview of the controls and two it gives you a glimpse of how the war went. This took me around 22 minutes to complete, from the time the game started launching until I could jump into multiplayer. I will also note I have yet to do any of the campaign as the EA Access only gives you 10 hours of play time, I wanted to capitalize on that time in multiplayer.

The Good:

I'm very happy as a PC gamer that I don't have to launch a website to browse for servers and can do everything in game. I don't know why the previous battlefield titles made you first go to the website and then launch the game, seemed just convoluted to me.

Graphics are great. Its a new game and I'm very happy with how it looks. The amount of detail in everything, the grass, the guns, the vehicles, the people, you name it. Looks great and I often find myself looking through my scope at the detail of buildings or vehicles.

The gameplay reminds me of when battlefield was great. I wasn't a huge fan of Hardline which I did spend hours on. I missed what battlefield was back in the day of getting a squad together, commanding some vehicles and total destruction of buildings, landscape, etc. Nothing beat knowing a sniper was up in a tower and blowing that tower up. Remember the big boat crashing into the shore on that one map? I missed that. I love the addition of those huge super vehicles for the losing team. My team was down a couple hundred points in conquest and this giant air ship spawned. I spawned into it, grabbed a gun and went to work. While we still ended up losing, it was a much closer game and I had a blast up in that air ship. The classes are perfect and I favor the sniper, does great at long range and can certainly hold his/her own when rushed.

Controls are easy and the PC controls follow that of the other battlefield titles. I was a bit confused in hardline at how to switch seats in a vehicle and realized it was the function keys, this time around the seats are labeled with the F1, F2, F3 etc keys so if you want to switch to the front gunner all you have to do is press the key associated with that seat, its simple and I like it.

The bad:

As of 10/14/16 @ 11am there have been some bugs with the PC version, maybe they will get fixed as again this is a pre-release I'm playing, maybe they won't in time for the rest of the masses to join in, I don't know. When trying to join a game via quick join I was stuck on ""matching your skill"" it sat there long enough for me to brew a pot of coffee and pour myself a cup. When you hit cancel you are just left looking at an overview of earth and you have to force close the game in order to try again. This is all over their forums and I was able to just open up the server browser and immediately join a game that way, but nonetheless still a bug.

Otherwise I really don't have any complaints. Dice made a great game and I will happily purchase the full product, at full price and play away.

"I will go four stars personally for the following reasons.  I'm a little disappointed in the bot building and then limitation of bots.  The cover even shows 5 Bots while the game provides three and you can only have 2 with you at a time of which you switch between.  I'm feeling like the game had more potential which was wasted.  It seems like much repetition is likely going to come quickly as I progress even further.  The last reason is so many jump puzzles which I'm not fond of really.  Outside of this, I think the game is actually pretty cool over all.  Granted a boss fight nearly had me throwing my new controller across the room.  lol  For me this game actually reminds me of some of the older star wars games that let you have a droid with you.  Then you put on some different graphics and change the game play up a little.  It worth 15 to 20 bucks though if you still like the ideas around it and my points do not scare you away.

"When I saw this game in the store I was sceptical. ... I had Hot Pursute 1 and enjoyed it, however I certantly would NOT pay [a high price for it]! I looked at it for a while, and after some convincing, I bought it. I was sure I would be dissapointed.
  Boy, was I wrong.
This game is cool. It has 100 times better graphics than anything in the NFS series so far. (Its not unreal tournament 3, but what is?) It had a better structure so that it felt more like a game than a racing simulator. Also the first one was sorta ""kiddy."" Now Im not the type that enjoys Grand Theft Auto 3 type games, but this felt a lot more like an exciting road rage than a boring race. Sure theres no violence... but the cops seem worried and sometimes when you drive through a city street you here screams of terror from inside the houses :). I could go on and on revieing this game, there is so much to talk about. But to spair all of you I will simply sum it up...
Pros: Nice graphics
  Better Gameplay
  Better Music
  The Cars Show Dammage :)
  The Police chases are FAR more intence with  hellecopters and road blocks.
  You get points to buy cars instaid of unlocking them
  You have a funky looking meter that shows you if you are getting away from the cops
Cons: Not a lot but there are a few things (like night racing) that are not included. This isn't a big problem for me however its one of those things where you say ""Come on guys! You made a good game, would it be that much harder to include something small like this?"" Oh well. No big deal.
One more Con for me is that there seams to be some black patches that flash across the screen sometimes... and sometimes the game freezes for about 5 seconds. This is probably just my computer though. MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A GOOD ONE!
  Thank you my friends, and
  happy gaming :)

"I am a stealth Clancy gamer when I play shooting games, but I liked the change of pace that is Call of Duty 4! I like the fast pace, almost no time to think reaction of the story modes.  Also the online gameplay is classic. However, online gameplay adds a bit more advantage and disadvantage from some ppl who do not equip themselves correctly.

Online, some people may have more health than you, or stronger. Sometimes head shots do not work either. That may be due to them equipping themselves with more life or a glitch.

"I am forced to admit that GT5 gives you a lot for your money, but there were so many head-slappingly inane decisions made about the gameplay that I am forced to give this a hostile review:

1.  The main thing I hated about this game was that there were no difficulty settings.  Basically you must take everything at full-bore difficulty, and woe to you if this is too hard.  But really, it's not that some of the tracks are hard so much as the WAY they were hard.  You're driving a car worth about 45,000 and they put you in races with supercars worth 20 million?  (Not just that, but there's no way you youself can possibly purchase such cars at this point.)  This is neither fun nor fair, but there's nothing you can do about it.  So you just start calculating to yourself, ""If I were to come in first place in this race 215 times, I would have enough money to buy one of those Ferraris.""

2.  Another gripe I have is that in this game, supercars are not supercars.  Naturally after you've been playing for a little while you will shop around for a Ferrari or a Lamborghini.  Don't spend your money:  instead, go to the Internet, where you'll find discussion forums that will tell you that you can get a much better-performing car for a lot less, say the Nissan GT-R.  But this is a little ridiculous.  The game doesn't seem right when a 2009 fully-decked out Lamborghini is getting comprehensively out-performed by a garden-variety Nissan sedan!  Something seems wrong.

3.  There are no Porsches to be had in this game, for licensing reasons, I assume.  This is probably not the programmers' fault, but still.

4.  One can maximally have only 20 million in the bank.  This really blows since the cars that cost 20 million will cost you more than that, since it's virutally impossible to ding 20 million precisely:  any money earned over that will simply not be recorded.  But what really blows is that when you finally buy that Lamborghini Miura, you'll have to garage it until you can buy tires for it.  This really seemed wrong.

5.  There exists a big gap between the Professional Series and the Extreme series.  Basically, if you'd like to continue into the Extreme Series, you're going to need a car that is worth several million dollars.  The problem is that nothing you can possibly do in the Professional Series is going to net you anywhere near that amount of money.  There is simply no way to transition smoothly from the Profeesional Series to the Extreme Series.  Hence the only solution is you've got to sit there for a couple of weeks running your B-spec drivers robotically around Daytona-style tracks until you have enough money to continue on with the next phase of the game.  So basically the game gets held up for a week or two while you get on to other things, such as your homework.  This was an asinine design decision.

6.  The player is not able to control realism settings.  You've got no choice but to put up with weather, tire burn-out, car damage, etc.

7.  The cars you win for finishing certain series can only be won once.  This doesn't make sense.  Can you imagine telling contestants in any sort of game that they can't win the prize because they've already won such a prize in the past?

8.  The game plays with you by racing cars against you that are not readily available for purchase, such as the Yellowbird or the Chaparral.  I did not find this amusing.

9.  There are not enough tracks!  This is because so many of the tracks are wasted on idiotic races (e.g., a tournament for the owners of a VW Lupo!?!?) that when you'd like to take one of your cars out for a race, there are only three or four choices to choose from?  You can only select the track of your choice if you're just practicing or if you're running cars that you don't own (i.e., GT mode).  But as for taking your beloved babies out on tracks you never get to see them on, forget it!  Those tracks are reserved for the pickup truck races!

10.  One is not allowed to restart races in tournaments.

11.  Having the cost of re-structuring the chassis be half of the car's value was totally unfair, as was the cost of an engine overhaul.  These prices are punitive, not realistic.  And what's the point of this anyways?  Next up:  having us pay for gas and insurance?  (Incidentally, I discovered that one's chassis breaks automatically without your even crashing the car.  Here's how:  1)  buy new car.  2)  enter race  3) immediately exit race before driving an inch.  You'll now have the option of restoring the chassis, implying that the car is damaged, since you're not permitted the option of paying for chassis repairs if the car is not damaged.)

12.  Your car has to come in for pitstops for new tires and stuff:  other cars don't.  On the Extreme B-spec races, for example, it is only your car that has problems with tires balding out about lap 9:  the other cars never seem to.  Why is that?

13.  The physics of the game don't make sense.  First of all, it's impossible to flip your car, no matter what you do.  There is no animation for it.  Neither do cars crash or show damage (though you have to pay for chassis damage).  But it goes deeper than that.  It seems like the physics of crashing and interacting with walls and other cars don't resemble reality.  For example, if you go off the track and hit a wall at, say, a 20 degree angle, your car will be smashed back to about a 160 degree angle, facing the wrong direction.  NEVER are you simply ""righted"" back to a zero degree angle.  It's almost as if the game is punishing you for crashing into walls, but in a way that doesn't make sense visually.  There's more, too.  There seems to be a sort of magnet effect going on sometimes.  Unlike my first example, this might actually be real physics:  I don't know, but it sure feels wrong.  What I mean is that when you run up on the rear end of the car in front of you, your car seems to ""stick"" and you can't detach yourself unless you completely slam on your brakes.  You can't simply scrape off to one side.  The same goes if your car is running along a wall, scraping along it at high speeds.  It seems like you ought to be able to steer away from it, detaching yourself.  But instead you're magically stuck to the wall somehow, and you can only veer away from it by greatly reducing your speed.

14.  Further, the physics of collisions seem unfair.  Every time you collide with another car, yours is the one that is bumped off the road into the sand, never the enemy's.  It seems like this should happen about 50% of the time, but no.  It's virtually impossible to knock an opponent's car off the track:  if you do, it recovers immediately.  It seems like if there is a collision, it negatively affects only your car.  Why do you always get the short end of the stick?

15.  The prices in this game are totally messed up!  You can buy a car for 2 million, deck it out with all the trimmings, and then, when you go to sell it, get about 200,000 for it, even though you haven't put a single mile on it!  This is not how reality works.  Realism-based, eh?

16.  The game keeps making you go over to Google to find out what kinds of cars you're talking about.  When you're in the used store, for example, how'm I supposed to know that an SLS AMG is a kind of Mercedes? [This was fixed in a patch.]

17.  As of the 2.02 update, the game has started to get more mercenary.  There will be cars displayed available for purchase, but you can't buy them unless you pay the company extra money for additional downloadable content through the PlayStation store.  A good example of this is the VW Golf '07.  Before the 2.02 patch, you could simply buy it from the new car dealership.  After December 2011, however, you had to pay more money (literal money, not game credits) to get that car.  Sheesh.  You figure if you lay out forty or fifty bucks for the game, they'd be done hustling you, but no.

18.  There's a huge gap with the difficulty at higher levels of the game:  they don't scale well.  After you get the Formula Gran Turismo, for example, it feels like you entered the cheat code and the remainder of the game is uninteresting, if not tedious.

19.  The manual sucks!  This game was released more than a year previous to this review, and by now you'd think people'd know how to play the game.  No.  For example, what causes chassis damage?  Is it aggressive driving?  Collisions?  Or simply miles?  Nobody seems to know.  Various websites have various theories, but nobody seems to agree about this basic thing.  But don't look to the manual to clarify that or anything else:  the most the extremely brief manual will tell you is ""if you have an epileptic seizure, you should stop playing.""

20. The tracks are aseptic, almost lifeless.  If I see the Monza circuit one more time, I'm gonna barf!  I can't put my finger on why the Need for Speed tracks seem so various and invigorating while those of GT5 seem so jejune, but it's definitely a problem.

21.  There's no way to upgrade your braking and steering.

22.  This game features ads up the wazoo:  currently for Motul, Agip, Dunlop, and some others.  These names will change with time because these companies have paid to have their logos plastered all over the racetracks and there's no way you can avoid them.

23.  There's no way to prevent the game from auto-saving.  This would have been useful in trying out a car you suspected was a crock. The Ferrari Enzo, for example, wasn't worth half the money you paid for it, but there was no way to test it out and then get your money back.

24.  The ""Seasonal Tracks"" require you to race with crummy cars or cars with a strict horsepower limit.

25.  Why can't I paint my cars any color I want as many times as I want?  I have like a billion dollars!  Instead I have to ""earn"" paint!?  It's ridiculous!

26.  There's some sort of bug (or other fun-ruining mechanism) whereby, in B-spec, your drivers don't get full credit for all the experience they accumulate.  This seems to happen about level 30.  You can put them through a 24-hour endurance race, and they'll only move up one level, not the several levels the raw points they've been given should net them.  Then, those excess points disappear somehow and are never counted.

27.  There is (alas!) a rather serious bug that's started to plague the game starting with the patch that came out in December of 2011.  When you are in the camera view that allows you to see the back of your car, the frame will jolt a bit every time you go around a turn to re-center itself.  This only starts happenening after you reach about 10 laps of the same track, but it means that endurance races will give you a headache.

28.  Er, howzabout warning me, before I spend more than 10 million on certain cars such as the Ferrari F1s that they cannot be used in normal races?  And that you're not allowed to sell them once you've bought them?  (As you can tell by this review, I played this game day and night for quite a while, but this was the thing that finally soured me on it and inspired me to write this cranky review.  Go, little review! Fly! May you decrease Polyphony's sales and cause them to go under!)

In sum, it's a little difficult for me to believe I have so many complaints about this game, but I do.  What's not showing, of course, is that I really got into it and played it for weeks.  Hence despite all these gripes I confess that it is well worth the money.  Here's a couple of things I liked about it:

1.  The game really gets you interested in racing history and you start reading a lot more about that subject.  That's gotta be considered a plus for a game.  This kinda starts when you're like, ""Wait.  Why would a '69 Ford be going for 20 million?""

2.  Initially I thought B-spec was the stupidest thing I ever saw.  Why would I want to watch the PlayStation play itself?  That was only until I realized you can set B-spec going while you went off to classes or to sleep and when you came back you'd have a whole bunch of money.  I admit I actually quite got into this:  it was oddly satisfying, heading off to work or wherever, knowing that you were kinda playing even though you weren't there.  It was a great opportunity to get a lot of other, real-life work done during this time.",1.0,B002BSA1C6,a mix of good and bad,Video Games

"For a good while now, every NHL game to come from Electronic Arts has focused more on an arcade-like presentation than a truer sim, while the rival 2K series (originally from Sega) provided a more authentic hockey video game.

"Visual Concepts vaunted NBA 2K franchise has a reputation for its high standards, and the series latest entry on the PlayStation 4 continues that sequence of slam dunks by towering over its PlayStation 3 counterpart. Not content with a mere visual upgrade, NBA 2K14 on Sonys next generation system plays a totally different ball game to its existing sibling  and while some of these enhancements undeniably have niggles, they're still terrific additions to an already excellent game.

This is a title thats drenched in more authenticity than a players vest at the end of a high-octane quarter. Recognisable commentators Kevin Harlan, Steve Kerr, and Clark Kellogg narrate with considerable clarity, while Doris Burke interviews various athletes at half-time. Meanwhile, sponsor video transitions pop up alongside NBA logos and help to sell the television broadcast feel as if it were real.
And this is, of course, where the visual prowess of the PS4 comes in, with each court feeling alive due to the varied crowds and immaculate models. There are moments where the immersion is so great that youll forget that its a game  even if the uncanny valley will creep in eventually when a player fails to convey the right emotion, or a couple of identical twins pop up in the audience and make the same cheering motion. The issues are more noticeable due to the outstanding achievements elsewhere  but the game sure does hint at plenty of promise for the future.

In fact, given that sports games have historically struggled with the generation jump, its amazing how realistic this title looks and feels. Animations are much more fluid and realistic, and theres a sense of physicality to the play that wasn't quite there before. In addition, the artificial intelligence is competent and, at times, lifelike  and thats without even mentioning the wealth of new modes and features.
For starters, My Career now plays out like a more structured narrative  a soap opera even. Cutscenes, dialogue trees, and personal objectives form part of your career and the story of your player. Upon picking a likeness, youll start shooting some hoops in the Rookie Showcase, discovering a rival that will follow you through your career and sculpting a personality that affects your team interactions and fan support.

Throughout your career, you can chat with your manager, coaches, and fellow players, having general conversations as well as more meaningful, life shaping ones. Youll begin by watching matches unfold from the bench, ready to jump in should an injury impede the game or the coach decide to take a chance on you. Then its all up to you to prove that you're worth a place in the starting line-up. Its a neat addition that provides a sense of progress to the campaign  even if the voice acting is weak and the coach interactions are restricted to text.
There are other issues, too. Youll encounter some of the same conversations with your coach multiple times, while youll often be given strange mid-match objectives that don't necessarily gel with your teams playing style. For as cute as the idea is, its not an especially engaging narrative either  but its at least a refreshing change from the bland campaigns that are otherwise so common in the sports genre.

Other modes include My GM, which allows you to manage an NBA franchise in a socially interactive style. Youll be able to converse with the teams owner, players, coaches, media outlets, and other executives to solve problems, help grow your franchise, and try to find the right balance between keeping everyone happy and managing your players on the court. As with the campaign, though, the dialogue is atrocious throughout.
Online, you can now play The Park street matches with buddies, as well as the standard head-to-head option. Meanwhile, the collectible card game My Team makes a return, which challenges you to create a fantasy squad in a similar style to FIFAs popular Ultimate Team. One new addition includes Domination, which allows you to pit your assembled squad against all-star teams and real-world rosters.

Conclusion

NBA 2K14 on the PS4 is a stunning digital facsimile of basketball. The titles visually jaw dropping, technically stunning, and represents a whole different ball game to its PS3 counterpart. The new My Career and My GM campaigns don't always score a slam dunk, but they're engaging enough to dribble your way through, making this is a top option if you're eager to shoot some hoops on Sonys next generation console.",5.0,B00DBRM3G8,Definitely Worth It,Video Games

"Well this takes me back! Got it in perfect condition, (Well almost). And a warning for you all, Burnout doesn't support the original PS1 controller so you need to get PS2 Dualshock 2 controller or I PROMISE you, it won't work.",5.0,B0002IQC8E,Brings me back the old memories!,Video Games
"Ideally, this is a game you would buy with 2 other friends, each chipping in about 15-20 bucks.  Ideally, each of you could play one of the 3 characters as you advance through the story.  Ideally, this game -- which is really quite eye-catching and fun to play -- would last you a few weeks.  Unfortunately, the latter 2 are not true and you're definitely better off splitting this game with some buddies rather than plunking down all of the cash for this yourself.  I beat the game sitting down with it one night.  It is an incredibly short game.
That's not to say it isn't fun.  I ended up playing it over and over again to buff up my characters (you really have to run through the game a few times to get each of the Bouncers pumped up to enjoy it).  Still, I couldn't help but feel cheated that a game that is as expensive as this one is should have lasted longer.  When I played Ps1 games like Jedi Power Battles, the Resident Evil series, etc., they would take me 1-3 weeks at least to finish.  Sadly, most of the ""first wave"" of Ps2 games are ""wham bam thank you sony"".
Like any of the first year games, this one is good for the combined fighting tactics you and the computer use to beat the bad guys.  It pains me that you could not get that 2nd joystick to work and have a buddy at least partner up with you.  If Jedi Power Battles can do that, why couldn't this game?  My expectations were set for a ""team up"" game -- and this game allows up to 4 people to play but only in the ""match"" mode.
As with any of the new Ps2 games, the story here less coherent than a Goddard film, but it is fun nonetheless.  Some of the combat and movie sequences are really cool (I'll nominate Dominque's ""coming out of the closet"" scene as my favorite).
Although I just got done rating ""X Squad"" with a 3, and I'd give ""Warlords"" a 4 stars, this one sadly deserves only 2.  I would buy it used or buy it with a friend so that after the adreniline high of the game is gone, and only 4-8 hours have passed, you're feel that it was worth it.
Oh, this one truly has some of the most absurd ""movie"" moments you're likely to see in a videogame.  I would swear that videogame scripts and plots have a weird aestethic up there with the films of Roger Corman and Ed Wood:  dialogue and plot connections so bizarre and painful that they are funny.",2.0,B000056SNY,"A very quick game, one  of the quickest out for Ps2, but fun",Video Games

"I have been loving the sims game since I got ""The Sims"" around 8 years ago. This game features the same style of gameplay and building, though with much more detail.

This game lets the player create ""styles."" Most pieces of furniture,cars,windows, ect can be customized by material and color. The player can save  the style and simply grag the color combonation onto other objects creating a perfectly matched room. No more mix matched furniture in your sims home!

The game also has an innovative sim building feature. You can now choose wieght, muscle mass, muscle definition. womens bust size.... As well as hair color,including roots, highlights,lowlights, and tips can all be changed accordingly. You can also choose lip,cheek,nose,ect shapes and make small minute changes including the slope of your sims nose. Very handy in recreating real life individuals.

This game also has many expansion packs that have been relieced and are contiueing to be recieced.

One little part of the game I enjoy is the fasmily tree. You can trace your sims family back to its roots. This is not important to game play, though I do really find this a fun little addition.

The sim store, an online official sim store allows your sims to add new furniture not avaliable with the base game to your game, though this costs additional real life money.

My problems with the game are few, glitches.

One of my favorite parts of the Sims 2 was custom content. I would download many houses, sims, cars, ect to my game made by players like you at home. If you didn't get carried away like I did at first, your game does not feature any problems.

In the sims 3 forums I have read that many custom contents have viruses attached. So for a while my game had no problems. I downloaded the sites 3rd most recommended house thinkning well if so many have doawnloaded it it is definatly safe. The game emmediatly slowed down, random freezes in gameplay, resolution was decreased, lots for a distance were warped and strange looking. A HUGE series of problems arose. I have to re-install my game to fix it and loose all my data.

My last problem is pretty simple. The content avaliable to buy at the sims 3 store is very limited. I want a simple womans shoulder length hair that swoops inward at the shoulder with some bangs, thats all. There is nothing close to what I want. All the hairstyles I could buy are ugly and outlandish!

"NOTE 1:  This is a review in progress.  I got the game during the midnight release and have been playing through the campaign.  More thoughts will be added as I finish the game.

NOTE 2:  I AM NOT an employee of 2K or Irrational Games.  All the writing you see are my opinions alone; see my other video game reviews (both positive and critical) if you need proof.

The first thing that's going to strike you about Bioshock Infinite is the setting of Columbia.  No longer are you stuck underwater and going through tight corridors as in Bioshock 1 and 2.  The openess of being on will be unlike anything you've experienced in an FPS before.  Many games try to give you the feeling their setting is alive (Skyrim immediately comes to mind), but few immerse you with real life issues (racism, etc.) as B.I. does.  You'll literally stop and listen to the various conversations, that is when you're not getting shot or melee attacked!

I don't want to give too much away, as I don't want to spoil the game for you.  Needless to say, some of the language is going to shock and awe you, so there's a reason the big ""M"" is on the front of the cover.  Definitely either have the kiddos away in bed or have a headset on.

The next thing is your trusty sky-hook.  No longer are battles confined.  Now, you can literally leap on the multitude of railings, slide down, see an enemy and drop on them to attack.  The freedom this opens up to approach different situations is a liberation.  Yes, some of the game is ""on rails"" and you won't have this opportunity through the entire game.  But there are always going to be limitations with software, hardware etc. that restricts visions.

Those familiar with Bioshock and Bioshock 2 know you carry a power in your left hand (called ""vigors"" in this game, previous veterans of Bioshock recognize these as ""Plasmids"") and a weapon in the right.  B.I. doesn't mess with this formula but DOES change your customization where it is much, much deeper.

You will also find various Gear lying around, of which you can equip a certain amount (4 to start).  These effects vary as well, from giving your Skyhook melee a shock charge to increased damage against certain enemy types.

When you add in the random things that Elizabeth brings into the fray later in the story (called ""tears""), the combinations are staggering and offers replay just to see how insane a setup you can create.  For example, you could have Murder of Crows equipped, initiate it, switch to Devil's Ball, which will catch your crows on fire, which will catch your enemies on fire, and Elizabeth warps in a machine gun turret which finishes the job.  It's honestly something hard to put into words.  You simply have to experience it for yourself.

Sadly, the weapons are pretty standard-fair for this kind of game (shotguns, machine guns, etc).  You could put a 1910 coat of paint on pretty much any COD gun and you have a B.I. gun.  Seems like a lost opportunity here.  The standard ""spend this to upgrade that"" is present in the game.  You will find locked chests which will make you hunt for keys.  However, what you find in these chests (infusions, which let you upgrade your shield, health or salt, respectfully, ala Skyrim) as well as Gear, etc. are WELL worth your time to seek and find the keys.

But what's a great action game without a story?  The basic gist is you are Booker DeWitt, here in Columbia to rescue Elizabeth.  Who just may be the most full-fleshed out AI character to date.  Through her communication, both verbal and non, you feel an engagement with her that you haven't felt in other games.  You actually CARE what becomes of her.  And that leads you to got he** bent on doing anything and everything to leave with her intact.  Again, I'm trying to keep this a spoiler-free review, but there are so many twists and turns in this story that by the time you hit 10 hours through the game you'll be like ""what the heck just happened???""  In a GOOD way.

Enemy AI is very smart, and just jumping on one of those sky-hooks isn't always enough to escape getting pummelled.  They take cover and, especially at a point in the middle of the game, will make you bring all your skills and items to bear or else you will find yourself dying.  Repeatedly.

Regardless of what you might have felt for Bioshock 1 or 2, or if you have never played a Bioshock game, the setting, gameplay and sheer scope of Bioshock Infinite are well worth the price of admission.  When history looks back on the PS3, this will become one of the defining games of this console generation and simply should not and cannot be missed.",5.0,B00GGUT7E8,"Bioshock Infinite Review:  Heads for the clouds, soars over the moon",Video Games

"I have a problem with this game? Question: ""What is a type of music that is hard to dance too?"" When I saw Rock and Roll and Jazz on the survey, I was wondering about the people surveyed to get these kind of answers on the list?

I'm a bit bewildered by the positive reviews of this game. I know fans love the game itself, heck, I consider myself a MAJOR fan of the actual game show and man I find myself going to YouTube to check out Richard Dawson in his prime. But it's not all bells and roses in this game on my beloved Wii. First the good stuff. How the questions are answered if flawlessly executed. I thought without a keyboard that answering questions would be a tedious task with the remotes, but it works well and how the suggestions instantly come up as you start typing is great. It's definitely better as a multiplayer experience and I love the classic intro music before the game starts.

But from there, this game is a disappointment. First off, why no ability to download new questions online? It can be easily done with the ability to go online with the Wii and at the Wii store, but no, you're stuck with the questions on the disc. I had repeat questions on my 2nd game, and in many cases, they were consecutive questions that were from the previous game. 1000 questions offered seems like a lot, but really? Is it? You can easily go through 25-35 questions a game. You're bound to find repeats and eventually you're going to hear them all depending how much you play the game. The presention is average at best. While the opening theme is there on the menu screen, it's not on the game itself. There is no game show host at all, and the guy who does that voice is a generic guy. Does the job, but needs more spunk. The people in this game are prerendered for you, heck you can't even use your Mii's in the game so again, you're limited. The avatars are pretty shallow, and while you can change their wardrobes somewhat, again, it's so limited to what could have been. The game also has some bugs. I noticed when you buzz in after playing consecutive games, that the buzz sound doesn't even work anymore. Um, hello quality control? And as I said above, some of the answers for the surveys should simply not be there. I always wonder if they ask these questions to hundreds of people like they say, but sometimes I wonder.

For the price you pay for this game, 1000 questions is not enough. The inability to download new ones even makes it more of a reason to be weary of spending your money on this. It's got some fun moments and yes, it feels and plays like the Feud. But over time, I think it will end up back on your shelf drawing dust in no time.",3.0,B002EWD04A,Order with caution..,Video Games

"Well I played Metal Gear Solid 4, and after I beat it I wanted to know more of the back story. I looked up Metal Gear Solid: The Essential Collection, for this offered $30 for all 3 games. This was perfect, no searching around everywhere buying separate overpriced games.

MGS1 was early PSX technology, it was one of the newer 3d games at the time. Like all MGS's it's mainly stealth gameplay. The enemy soldiers are the easiest of the MG series. It's a good introduction into the gameplay until later titles. Your main character is Solid Snake who has to rescue 2 hostages, but the mission becomes much more. He has to stop the Metal Gear, a weapon of destruction. The villians in this one as well as other Metal Gear's are strange and introduce you to their back stories along the way. You'll meet up with Meryl in the game, a lady soldier who helps you out at times. This game is actually my 2nd favorite MGS game after 4.

MGS2 has some mixed reviews, let's just say you won't play Snake the whole time. You'll also play as Raiden a new soldier being sent out to rescue the president, and prevent an explosion and environmental disaster on a water base. You do get the impression of him being a rookie, he complains at times, and seems to be learning with each new sitution. He's an ok character to me.

The thing I don't like in this game mainly for me is the base itself, it seems like your going back and forth in circles. Like go to Strut A and to Core 2, to Strut AB. You do this alot. The spy robot are also a pain, I prefered the cameras. Now the story is good, like the other MGS's. This is the least favorite game still out of the series, not good exactly overall but ok.

MGS 3 is the hardest out of all MGS's for me. I've died quite alot. You play Big Boss when he was younger, known now as the original Snake. You'll have a lot of enemies bunched together. It's a harder to stealth enemies. You have the added camoflouge in this game accordingly to the envirionment your in. For example dirt plantless environment, dark, forest, etc. The enemies are hard to see themselves, they take on the color of their environment. This game has the best story in my opinion, but it's hard and can be frustating.

The enemies in this are crazy as always, a guy with bees and a 100 year old sniper or some of them. In all the MGS's you get a radar, in this game you only get sonar. The sonar you have to click the R3 button, so it's tougher in this one. You can change the camera angle in this subsitence version, the older MGS 3 you couldn't. The camera change in this does help somewhat.

There's just no beating this deal. If your interested in even 1 MGS game, just get the whole pack it's $30 anyways. I'm glad I have the whole story line now, and going through them a second time should be easier. Remember some of them you get away less with stealth than others, so be wary. I really enjoyed this series.",5.0,B001383L36,Liquid Snake,Video Games

For myself, Final Fantasy X has been what all the others were for me: a very entertaining diversion that kept me glued to the console until I finished playing the game two or three times. The worlds in the FF games are always enormous, and it hasn't been unusual for me to spend 120 hours on a single playthrough as I seek out everything the game has to offer.
This is a very linear game, as other people have observed. Myself, I find that linearity rather compelling, as the stakes keep rising the closer the pilgrims get to their goal.
Filled with the usual twists, turns and shocks that players have come to expect from this series, this one's a corker of an adventure with graphics and sound unlike any game you've ever experienced.
I just finished the game yesterday, and I have to say that it was one of the most satisfying gaming experiences I've ever had.  No, the final bosses weren't all that tough, but they were appropriate to the story:  you understood why you were fighting them and what was at stake.  After the showdown, you're treated to a theatrical-quality animated denoument that will move all but the most cynical.  I was so enthralled by the experience that I immediately went back and played the final bosses again, just to see the end of the story one more time.",5.0,B00005TNI6,"The real question is, should you buy this game?",Video Games

"LOTR Return of the king is a great game that will have you playing for hours and hours.  The graphics are amazing they make the Two Towers game look like an N64 game.  The animation is very smooth and who can forget the amazing effect.  In the beginning of game you will pick one of three paths to follow.  You can pick Sam and Frodoes (play as Sam or Frodo) adventure of getting the ring to Mount Doom.  You can pick Gandafs adventure (play as Gandaf) as he helps to take down Isingurd and defend Minas Tirith. The last path to take will allow you to play as Aragorn, Legolas, or Gimli, as they cause all kinds of hell, from fighting dragons, to ghosts, to thousands of Orcs and Goblins, and other things in black armor.  There are also three secret characters that you can unlock. (one of them is Golom). Return Of The King will offer more then 15 different levels to play.  In a lot of levels you can interact with items and weapons, like shooting a catapult or big battle bows, to climbing latter's and sliding down ropes.  A cool new feature to the game is Co-op mode.  This means you can fight every level with a friend at your side.  If you don't have any friends you can play with a random person online, how cool is that.  The only reason I give this game four stars is one the Camera angle can screw you up in some places.  At times the camera will be perfect at other times you won't be able to see crap.  Another problem is they haven't changed the formula of the game.  In almost every level you go to an area kill 50 Orcs and go to the next area.  Not all the levels are like that but a lot of them are.  Every character has three basic attacks quick attack, fierce attack, and ranged attack, you can also parry.  As you kill enemies you will gain experience, which will allow you to buy new attacks and combos. In the end LOTR Return Of The King is a great game, you should definitely by it.

"Tales of Hearts R feels like relic from the past. Despite being a remake of a Japanese only DS game, its aesthetics and playstyle feel like they hopped right off the PS2 circa 2001. It features relatively blocky graphics with limited animations, generic synth music, a Working Design quality translation (minus the memes), three-building sized towns with static NPCs, and a story that wouldn't look out of place side-by-side with Tales of Phantasia.

But these aren't knocks against the game. Tales of Hearts R revels in feeling like a lost classic. For as generic as the story is it's also endearingly charming and blindingly optimistic. Things take time to get moving but eventually the colorful cast of anime cliche characters take center stage to steal your heart. At the end of the day the plot resembles Phantasia to the core -- an ancient race from a doomed planet wants to restore it by destroying yours -- but the localization is so tight that all the story beats strike a chord even if you've seen them all before.

But Tales has largely been about combat and it doesn't disappoint. Starting off with the simple 3-hit combos and generic artes, you eventually gain access to a simple points-based system allowing you to boost a core attribute (hp, sp, physical, and so on) while also unlocking skills and artes that you can assign. Characters can also bond with each other, a system that increases as they fight together or through story skits, which allows them to share skills if they have a strong bond. Each bond is accompanied by a cute little thought bubble which adds more flavor to an otherwise mundane video game mechanic.

ToHR puts more emphasis on blocking than other games in the series. There are several skills that increase damage reduction from blocking and enemies have an ability to break your combos with a powerful attack. Blocking this attack at the right moment executes a counter which stuns an enemy and allows you to rack up higher combos. New to this system are ""chase links"" that when activated allow you to knock around an enemy through the air like a scene from Dragon Ball Z. The high encounter rate makes certain dungeons exceedingly dull but this battle system contains some of my favorite boss encounters out of the entire series.

Tales won't wow RPG veterans you but as an original handheld RPG it's a good title as well as one of the better entries in the series. This would've turned heads 15 years ago on the PS2 yet as old as it feels it's still exceptionally well made if you can get over how generic the opening hours are. Here's to more original traditional-style RPGs on handhelds.",4.0,B00N46SH98,Feels like a lost PS2 classic.,Video Games
"There's a lot of potential here. There are a lot of different ways to input commands on the controller, and it more or less takes PC gaming to your couch.

However, the software for the controller is terrible, and valve doesn't put forth any effort to help you figure out whats wrong. The controller doesn't save configurations for games, and since it's nonstandard, that basically means that the left joystick isn't going to work in game (tested in Fallout 4, GTA V, Tomb Raider, and Assassins Creed) so you can't move your character. Only look around.

I am going to return this controller, and would advise anyone against buying it. However, I think when the Steam Controller 2 comes out, it will be a game changer (hopefully)",2.0,B016KBVBCS,Has potential,Video Games

"I had just finished Batman Arkham Asylum and was going through withdrawals when I decided to play this game.  Yep, it cured my withdrawals with it's addicting story, easy controls, and cool moves. You want to keep playing it to level up the character Cole. It's a blast unlocking and getting the new moves and using them to  either kill or not kill (your choice) some of the bad guys.

"These are fantastic headphones. There is plenty of cushion in the ear cups and on the over the head strap. These extra soft cushions allow me to wear them for hours without feeling any strain or fatigue.

The sound is fantastic. I am able to hear heavy base along with notes at all spectrums. This fantastic sound has really made my gaming and video streaming experience that much better. It is like hearing a surround sound system inside of my head. It is truly fantastic. There is even a toggle volume on the back of the left ear cup that allows me to easily control the volume up or down when I need to.

The cord is thick and quite durable. The braided material on the outside of the cord really gives it that extra strength. The cord is 7 ft long which really allows me plenty of room to comfortably move around while it's plugged in.

The microphone works well too. I've spoken to friends online while gaming and all of them state that I come through clearly without any distortion or feedback.

My only complaint is that I do wish that it had an inline control on the cord, but I have simply adjusted my gaming to where I do not need it.

Overall, I would recommend this headset. The sound in it is incredible. The other aspects are all fantastic. The headphones are made with quality. I rate this 5/5 stars.

"Not only a visual delight but the sounds of a carnival will put this elegant game right in your lap and you'll be hearing ghostly echoes- shrieking  children, crunching leaves, popcorn popping, snake oil barkers pitching their wares. You are plunged into an  atmosphere of an amusement park that looks bright on the surface  but is really decaying and is really evil, a miasma hovering  over everything. It is winter with the trees bare and seeming to writhe and sullen leaves blow in your path.

The extremely cluttered hidden object scenes are very clear and in sharp focus and will send HOG enthusiasts straight to Nirvana. However, some objects are miniscule or tucked into dark areas. Often you have to combine two objects before you can clear them- such as putting black stripes on a white horse with a paintbrush to get the required zebra. One object  to be found in each search environment will go into your inventory for use later and it's not always easy to figure out what does what.

An evil dwarf  who owns the decrepit carnival is out to capture souls and you have to beat him at his own game to win back your little brother, whose  soul is hanging in the balance. The dwarf's creepy, gloating voice issues from loud speakers as you make your way through the carnival. You will confront many mini-games some of which are familiar but they are nicely choreographed and the producers have put their own spin on them - they're fun rather than daunting. A handy map allows you to quickly jump about the carnival without having to slog your way on your own.

I may sound like I'm gushing but I AM gushing! This adventure takes a long time to play through and there are no fluffy fillers. You will be hooked right away by this beautiful game as the atmosphere envelops you. The only two things I would change are the hint mechanism that takes forever to rev up and the title ""Dreamland"" which seems inappropriate for such a macabre place. That may be the point, though, the amusement park being more of a nightmare and therefore a huge contrast to the cheerful place the carnival once was.

P.S. SPOILER
At the end of the game is a very tricky puzzle. You have to position 6 doves in the cemetery. The only way to get them in the right spots is to press the hint button while aiming in the dove direction. Copy the position of the doves and release the hint button, then place them in their correct slot.",5.0,B005FAH5EY,Stunning!,Video Games

Keep in mind, as your kingdom grows, so do your loyal subjects, the interaction with is a bit bare as they only greet you, but they also fall in love/get married, and create more subjects for you. Exploration plays a huge part in the game as every area has foes, treasure, and other collectibles to ransack.

That being said, this game is probably one of the top launch titles for the 3DS, its fun, engaging, and the 3D effect makes you forget about the graphics (which really aren't that important in a turn based game like this). Also you play multiplayer with the same 3DS which is perfect because being a new system, non of my friends have one yet so being able to play on one system works well.

"This was my first fighting game.  I had a few friends teaching me the basics and some more advanced stuff but most of the time I found myself spamming the moves I could pull off easily.

The things I like about the game are the online ranking system, it works well.  I find myself at about 50:50 for win/loss, which in my eyes shows matchmaking is doing a good job at keeping it challenging, yet rewarding.

The main story mode is kind of hit or miss.  I can't bring myself to watch the cheesy cutscenes and movies.  Having to unlock some of the characters can be grueling as well.  Some people just run right through Seth (Cammy, Zangief, Rufus, the French fighting guy, and Sagat).  I was never able to get the hang of the charge characters.  I've used a joystick and controller (with Kontrol Freeks), and I do much better with the controller.  There's not really a good way to learn these moves either because if you don't do them fast enough it doesn't count it as a move anyway.

The graphics are cartoony, but good.  I mean, there really isn't much to program except about 12 maps, 100 moves, and 30 characters, so it should have good graphics.  My friends complain about how much less skill this game takes over SF2 because the moves don't require as much speed and accuracy on the controller.  Where it was my first fighting game, I kinda need all the help I can get.

All in all, it's not my thing, I'm more of a CoD and Forza person, but this game was fun to learn and play around with from time to time.",4.0,B0012N3ZXS,Overall it's pretty good.,Video Games

"Vastly improved over MUA1, MUA2 with much improved controls and character power fusions MUA2 offers me the experience I was hoping for from MUA1 and brings back the fun lost after the X-Men titles.

On the PS3, the character control and power access is smooth and intuitive.  The replay with different teams of characters has so far been high.

The only drawbacks to the game are the dark backgrounds which seemed to appear after the X-Men series and the cumbersome inventory systems for the boosts. I did try the game on more than one TV and the backgrounds are dark. Not a huge issue overall and you get use to it.

Other than that MUA2 offers all the button matching fun from the first two X-Men games with updated graphic, sounds, and character utilization. It's also good to get through Marvel's Civil War without Captain America dying.

Minor issues: As with all the titles in this series playing the character Wolverine can speed you through the game with little challenge. As mentioned earlier the dark backgrounds and cumbersome inventory systems for the boost of the characters.

"Quantum Break was one of the games that made me want to get an Xbox One. I wasn't too impressed with it when I first saw a look of it at E3 2013. But as the years went by and the more I saw of it from trailers and gameplay, the more it got my attention. Once I got my hands on the game and played it, I was hooked into the story and gameplay of Quantum Break. Story was well written and the narrative gets more interesting when you read the intel collectibles that can easily be found as you progress through the game, and it has a great cast that keeps the plot growing strong by their performance in voice, motion capture, and acting in game and the live action show, which are 22 minutes per episode. Gameplay is both 3rd person shooter with time powers. It may seem meh, but when you play it for yourself, it's cool. The only downside with the game I have is I wish it was longer. The full game consists of 5 acts and took me 7 hours to beat on Normal Difficulty. I plan on playing it through again the second time on Hard and picking the alternate choices in the junction chapters that I didn't pick the first time, which by the way do have major changes to the narrative depend on your choices.

"Okay, let's get the worst over right from the start: the interface is bad.  It's as simple as that: it is a very poor interface and it actively hampers the game (which is why I'm dinging it a full two stars).  I understand what the designers were shooting for, which is a thoroughly immersive and natural interface, but the mouse isn't the right technology for what they were attempting.  Now, if VR gloves ever start to penetrate the consumer market, then such an interface could be justified.
That said, if you can grit your teeth and look past the interface (and, for many players, that's just not going to be possible), the game itself is nothing short of revolutionary.  It's complex, its detailed, it's *entertaining*, it's imaginitive, and, above all else, it is utterly engrossing.  I've never played a god-style game where you actually started to feel like a deity in charge of real people, with the full range of responsibilities and, most innovatively, moral choices that such a being would face.  It's refreshing that the game doesn't compell you to be a good guy, or punish you for being a bad guy.  In spite of that, I've found that it's actually rather hard to deliberately be a malevolent deity for the very reason that you are so thoroughly powerful and your people are so thoroughly powerless.  Indeed, when I accidentally wreck havok (see above notes regarding the interface), I tend to feel bad about my actions and I find that I want to do something to set things right.  I suspect that, for many people, the game is going to be a moral ink-blot.
I can't over-stress the problems with the interface.  I can understand why that would suffice to drive a person away from the game.  It's also true that the game has stability issues (thank the avatars that I had a spare computer to install it on; it simply locked on the livingroom system in spite of all efforts).  But it's also true that there is much to love about this game and, if nothing else, I would encourage people to buy it just to support this style of game and this level of creativity in game design.  It may be a flawed child, but it is still a gifted infant.",3.0,B00004UE0O,"Great game, bad interface, but it is, perhaps, worth it.",Video Games
"Title: Fable

Description: What path will you choose? The highly anticipated and arguably over-hyped fantasy/ adventure game from an extended Microsoft developer. This unique game claims to have extreme character versatility and game possibilities. Your appearance and skills will be altered by things you do in game. If you eat too much you get fat if you fight a lot you will get large and brawny and you also age. Fight the forces of evil or join them. You can adventure with thieves or settle into domesticity with your new wife (male or female.)

Platform: Xbox

Learning Curve: 7- With so much to do in the game expect to spend some time familiarizing yourself with the many skills and spells and also basic social interaction. I don't think you need to have ""1337 g4/\/\3R"" skills to fight and advance in the game, but the fighting system might take a bit of practice and the game gives you tutorials early in the game.

Replay Value: 9- The standard storyline will have the limitations of what it is, but if you stray from the intended path you can play the game many times altering your persona to be good or evil. Slaughter merchants or be a dastardly polygamous the possibilities can go on and on.

Difficulty: 5- This game has an average level of difficulty from what I can tell. With proper training and skill purchase most enemies shouldn't pose a problem.

Guide: Available through Prima publishers for $14.99. I'm surprisingly satisfied with this guide so far. The guide helps navigate the game easier and might help you get through some puzzles if you are stumped.

Pros: Versatile gameplay, awesome graphics, hilarious dialogue, addictive gameplay, and interesting follow through storyline.

Cons: Main character is as imagined ""generic"" to permit versatile play, camera angle with bow can get jumbled, D button controls are sloppy, and ""noble"" heroes will have to be careful for villagers wanting a part in battles with monsters and I often found myself accidentally hacking the occasional merchant.

Time Expected to Invest: As much time as you want, but I imagine most people will find a good month or so of solid play before they are off to another title. I think I will enjoy this title for a bit longer though.

Retail Value: $49.99

Suggested Purchase Price: worth over $40. Try to find it used if possible or wait until the price goes down.

Overall: 9- I admit I really like this game, but I'm trying to keep the casual gamer and expectations in mind when I rated this over all. I think some will be disappointed by the gameplay not being as ""versatile"" as many thought it would be, but really if there wasn't some kind of guided story involved for more ""linear"" gamers you'd just have a pet character on a game that would wonder around aimlessly with no direction. I like the option to do either in this game and I think many gamers will feel the same. Was this game too overly hyped? Perhaps, but I am still satisfied with the outcome. Is it a disappointment? No, disappointment is getting ready for the second time for a lunch date only to have the person inform you when they call that they are too ""tired"" to meet that commitment. I swear I had to get ready, drive into the city, and wait until she got off again and then... sorry off topic. Anyway, no I was satisfied by this game and that is enough for me to consider my purchase worthwhile. I recommend this title and I think while not ""revolutionary"" the game brings something new and fresh to gaming.",5.0,B0001UEHP8,I'm satisfied due to reasonable expectations.,Video Games
"A fat plumber called Mario was quite the icon during my childhood days. In those days, you weren't cool unless you played a Super Mario Bros. game or two. Super Mario Bros. 3 was one such games, and it was no doubt one of the most popular games in Nintendo's 100-odd-years history.

Super Mario Advance 4: Super Mario Bros. 3 is almost an exact replica of that game. Porting the game over to the GBA, Nintendo has made some minor changes to the it, but the large part of it remains essentially the same old of old. Which makes it a rather nostalgic run down the memory lane for gamers from the 80s' era, who are still gaming. Like me.

For the uninformed, the mission of Mario and Co. is simple. You will need to save a Princess (duh!), and to do that, you will need to battle through different levels in nine worlds. Going through all the worlds painstakingly is not compulsory though, if you happen to be strategic with some items you collect along the way, but the more accomplished Mario fans will tell you there's more fun in doing it ""the right way"".

Of course, doing it that way means a very long, and sometimes tough journey. You get upgrades when the game progresses, allowing you to change into various costumes. One of these is a raccoon suit that allows you to sweep your enemies with your tail, and to fly up to the sky. Pretty nifty, if you ask me. Other costumes lets you split fire, swim faster in water and throw hammers, etc. All of these give you some advantage in certain situations, but knowing when, and how to use them effectively is a different story.

Graphics wise, the colors look every bit as vibrant as they were, but the pictures are a little short when compared to modern standards. This has always been a problem with porting classic games onto the GBA. Still, I'm not a fussy person. Graphics have never been an issue for me when it comes to games, or I'd have bought an XBox.

The audios in this game are ok, although the music sounds like it has been remixed. Some of the in-game comments are a little corny, for example, when Mario gets a costume upgrade, he yells out: ""That's what I needed!"". This gets old after, like, two minutes. The special effect audios are as good as ever, so you get the classic ""ting"" sound when you latch onto coins, and the robotic tunnel-climbing sound when you get into one of those secret tubes, which is cool.

The changes in this version of Super Mario Bros. 3 now allow you to save your change. A welcomed move, surely, but the game is so easy, you probably won't need the feature if you intend to go through it speedily with the magic whistles. Oh, did I say magic whistles? Ok, I shall shut up. Other additions include five advance medallions per level, and a chance to take on the classic Mario Bros. game. If you're just buying this game for Super Mario Bros/ 3, you may conveniently ignore all these.

In conclusion, Super Mario Advance 4: Super Mario Bros. 3 is a classic revisited. It's an adventure with the qualities to impress fans, whether young or old, and will no doubt add hours of fun for you on the GBA. This is a game truly worthy of the Super Mario Bros. franchise.",4.0,B00009WAUO,Do not underestimate the powers of a fat plumber.,Video Games

So playing this again 20 years after I rented it and finally beating the thing (yeah, I'm going to count Game A as winning because Game B is just too darn hard) was actually somewhat depressing for me.  Stuff that I once experienced as brand new is deteriorating with age.  As fun as Kung Fu is to play, who's going to go out of their way to hunt this obsolete title down when they have the newest Final Fantasy games flashing in their faces?

This is definitely one of the best games on the most important video game system ever made.  Its very, very easy to play.  Perhaps one of the easiest to play games you'll ever find, other than Cruisin' USA.  Jumping can be somewhat of a pain but other than that the controls are very smooth.  Dodging attacks can be extremely tough but the ease of the controls helps you out a whole lot.  That's the main thing that makes this such a great game.  Quality controls.  I even like its classic first-generation NES graphics.  Its just like Excitebike.

But, like I said, the newer games with the better graphics and enhanced play control options (lets face it, you can do more things with 8 buttons on a control pad than 2) are now greatly overshadowing simple games like this one.  Not that that's a bad thing.  Its just nice to feel stuck in time every once in a while...",5.0,B00004SVXV,An Epiphany,Video Games

"First and foremost i was so dissappointed at this game,
it has so much potenial but lacks in graphics and controls,
certains times when your playing you can easily forget the buttons and mess up,
next what the hell is up with that camera sometimes its good the other times it moves on its own,
the enemies have that survival horror look and feel but just doesnt creep you out like silent hill or dead space,
dont get me wrong alone in the dark has its moments and could have been something exciting but the real reason that it kills me so much is THEY FORGOT ABOUT THE WII!
if you look at the ps3 version it makes the wii version look like they just tried to make the wii version watered down,
i no that ps3 has HD but come on u didn't have to change up the game because of the HD quality,
the game didn't need all of the HD quality to make it good its just needed its original gameplay to make it great,
please if your going to get this game get it for ps3 to expierence it the way its suppose to be,
sorry wii even tho i love this system,
alone in the dark forgot about you!

Both the single and multi-player portions are well done (the multi-player game originally suffered from horrendous lag and connection problems, but Infinity Ward's patch sorted those problems out).

"I'm a new owner of the PS3 since i bought the new one last month. Bought it with uncharted drake's fortuned and absolutely loved it. Played through it in 1 sitting. Was really excited about the second one but was ultimately worried that my expectations were too high and that somehow i would be disappointed. Well... that s not the case. It even exceeded my expectations. Graphically it is a breathtakingly beautiful masterpiece especially if it's on an HD tv. I doubt that in the months to come that a game will be able to top its graphics (at least until Heavy Rain comes out). The action stays the same but as they say if it ain't broke don't fix it. The fighting is slightly refined and the stealth mode is a wonderful addition although it gets kind of frustrating sometimes. A helpful little addition is the aiming reticle while blindfiring which was missing from the first. The story is even better than drake's fortune and the scenery is varied as opposed to jungles and underground catacombs in the 1st one also. Although i would prefer more challenging puzzles they did a good job on that too.  Overall, they managed to put together something bigger and better and well worth all the hype it has been getting. I am very happy with my purchase and strongly suggest that anyone who like cinematic hollywood-type games to add this to their PS3 library.",5.0,B001JKTC9A,wow... just wow...,Video Games

"While many believe that the simplictity of this game is it's downfall, I for one think that it is what makes the game so darn fun. I ussualy wasn't one to play too many baseball sims as they got too complex or tedious but this game is just right for me and all of you others like me who think baseball is kind of a slow game. All your favorite carachters are here and thensome. We have Mario, Wario, Peach etc. but we also have some obscurities like King Toadstool and Trixie Kong. Each carachter has their own specialty (other than balanced players i.e. Mario, Power players are good at hitting hard and pitching hard and fast but tend to be slow runners. Speed players tend to be good fielders and baserunners but average hitters and pitchers. Then there are technique players which as far as I can tell excell in pitching and are ok at everything else. Each player also has their own star power that when tapped into allows the player to hit or pitch with cool powers like a flame ball for Mario. That isn't the only piece of Mario flavor that finds itself in the game. Every field has it's own obstacle that is ussualy a staple in the series such as piranha plants that eat and spit out your ball. This game has the full range of modes but nothing really worth talking about. Over all this is a great great game for those of you looking for a simple fun sports game or a young baseball fan who wants a video game that is easy to play. Caution though, baseball purists will probably be turned off by this games simplicity and ablitity for games to end in a tie. Another annoyance is the announcer who has a kind of annoying voice but those gripes really aren't big enough to hurt the score. 5 stars.",5.0,B0009XEC0C,Simplistic Bliss,Video Games

"First, let me start out the review by saying that the ""over 50 hours of gameplay"" claim on the back of the CD case is an outright lie.  I beat it in under 6 hours my first (and only) time through.  From what I've heard and read, 5-10 hours is average.  In other words, don't expect the weeks of entertainment the packaging promises...
So, onto the basic premise of the game.  You're a young boy named Rion.  You wake up in a lab with no memories and an array of psychic abilities, apparently received while you were the unwilling subject for some sort of experimentation.  You begin the game by escaping your restraints and trying to win your freedom.  As you progress through the game's 4 areas, the story unfolds through character interactions and beautiful movies and images usually triggered by some sort of psychic flashback or intuition related to various objects and locations.
The gameplay basically involves battles (that are usually few and far between) and puzzle solving (mostly of the ""find items and keys and figure out where to use them"" variety).  Your main weapons in battle are your psychic abilities, enhanced by chemicals called PPECs.  You start out with 2 offensive abilities.  Nalcon allows you to send sort of an attack wave ...  You'll get a 3rd ability (albeit a fairly useless one) halfway through the game.  So, you're basically left with 2 fairly weak main attacks, each taking more than one hit at full power to take out all but the simplest of enemies.
The game's weapon and healing systems all rely on drugs.  You have certain amounts of offensive drugs in your system.  When they run low, you have to inject yourself with more.  When your health runs low, pop a pill.  You also have ""anger points"" that rise just from walking around and rise more rapidly when you use psychic powers.  This is due to the interaction of drugs in your system, and when the AP meter gets to high, you ""short"", which is basically a psychic overdose that leaves you walking around with a big migraine.  The plus side:  Every enemy you go near while shorting will die violently.  The negative side:  Your health will go south rather quickly until you stop the shorting by taking a pill called delmetor.
Enemy battles are usually easy, except for a handful of very difficult end bosses that take a while to defeat and a few instances where enemies attack you 3 at a time, leaving you frustratingly unable to fight back.  Strategy is limited, usually involving running around in circles until you have enough time to charge your powers and attack.
As for the graphics and sound, they're both excellent for the Playstation.  The general game graphics are nice, sharp, and detailed.  The movies (which are the reason the game spans 3 discs) are also quite impressive.  The sound is excellent, from eerie music down to the footsteps that let you know an enemy is pacing around the corner...
The controls..well..they're annoying.  If you've never played a survival horror game, the stiff controls will prove to be a great annoyance.  If you're a survival horror veteran, they'll be a familiar annoyance.  Having to charge up your psychic powers in order to attack with any effectiveness adds to the frustration as it's sometimes hard to target fast moving enemies while charging, leading you to miss often and waste your PPECs..
Overall, I'd say don't buy this game, rent it.  It's a rather enjoyable game with a great storyline and entertaining puzzles.  However, as I stated earlier, it will only last you a couple nights, and since the main thrill of the game is following the storyline and figuring out the puzzles, it has practically no replay value.",4.0,B00004LN2V,An enjoyable survival sci-fi game with some flaws,Video Games
"High Heat 2003 for the PS2 is a great baseball video game, despite the lack of a Franchise mode which is the biggest problem with this game. I am used to playing Sega's World Series Baseball series on the Dreamcast and personally think both series' are basically equal except that High Heat's Franchise mode is a little more in-depth.
Graphically this game is awesome. The players look like the real life players and their pitching styles and batting stances are head on.
The gameplay in this game is pretty good. Pitching involves pressing one of four buttons for a certain pitch and square if you want it to be outside of the strike zone or circle if you want it to be in the zone. One thing I think that should be in the pitching is to be able to aim where you pitch like you can in World Series Baseball. Fielding is very simple using all four buttons to throw to a certain base. And a great feature in this is being able to rob homeruns without having to press several buttons. But fielding is a pain for some people, having to use the control pad instead of the analog stick often screws you up and you can't tell where you are going. It is also almost impossible to throw out a runner attempting to steal unless you are a veteran at this game.
The Franchise mode in this game is equally as good as WSB 2K2 and better in some ways. Fro trading, to retirements, to free agent signings to rookie drafts, to minor leagues, it's all here in the Franchise Mode where you have total control over your team. You can choose to play with the real rosters or do a fantasy draft which is like being in a fantasy baseball league, except you get to play the games. This is my favorite mode in this game.
The lack of a few things in the gameplay bring my rating down from a 5 to a 4, but this is still a wise choice for PS2 owners looking for a solid baseball game.",4.0,B00005V5LP,Probably the best baseball game on the PS2,Video Games

"After reading all the negative reviews, I was expecting a real dud when I finally got around to ""End of Ages,"" and considered not even bothering with it.

"OK i have gone thru 4 controllers now and so far this fills the bill on everything but 3 details. The controller is great its self the buttons are very responsive and, the 360 layout (reversed analog sticks) are very easy to get use to. The controller changes to seven different colors yellow, dark blue, pink, red, green, light blue, and lastly white. The L1,R1,L2,R2 button are very good i actually prefer them over my dualshock. Unfortunately like all third party controllers this one isn't perfect. The complaints i have are one, it requires a dongle receiver and with the slim the only room i have is for 1 charging cord and the dongle. The second complaint i have is the start and select layout it has five buttons shaped like a bat that go battery life check, select, home, start, and the color changing button, to me it should have the start and select buttons as the outer buttons.
My last complaint is more of a misunderstanding i suppose, on the back it says custom L2,R2 triggers what i thought they meant was you can flip the L1,R1 with L2,R2 but I'm guessing what they mean is the curve in the R2,L2 triggers, which is kind of a bummer seeing as the R2,L2s are more comfortable.

"When I was in the 3rd grade I picked up this game my the local video game store. Little did I know that it would still be enertaining and addicting for repeated plays 8 years later. Being so young, it took me a while to catch on to the game. It would take me so many game years to build a farm and earn money for a family. But the more I learned and understood the game, the more I learned to love the characters and their stories. I have heard people say the characters in this game are one dementional and have no personality but I beg to differ. Your shipper falls in love with a married woman, a homeless man struggles to stay in town and deal with his past, a young nurse must help raise her little brother properly, etc. Over the years I have found myself more attached and loving the whole town. So, for sentimental reasons this game is a total 5 out of 5 for me. But being serious...

  I love the farming in this game by far the most out of all of the Harvest Moon games. Some of the problems with later Harvest Moon games is being too complicated and difficult to earn money. This is the simple and basic farming system with just some added features. Chores don't take too long but they also don't take too short, giving you just enough time interact with your neighbors. One problem I did have is that the horse is too hard to actually ship crops with. If you try to use him he runs away. You are better of just using a basket. Also, the dog never actually uses his dog house. Which is pretty lame and weird if you ask me.

  Like I said above, I love the town in this game. While other games in the series have boring characters and plots, this does not. The town is beautiful and I have always loved the character animation. Courting the woman of your choice is one of the best parts of the game. It is fun triggering heart events and eventually starting a family with them. The only complaints I have are that sometimes the English writing will switch languages and there are grammar errors....what Harvest Moon game doesn't have this problem....? And, once you have a child the game is basically over. It never grows up and not much more happenes. It would have been nice if the child could grow up and the town's story continued just a bit more.

  Overall, if there was any Harvest Moon game I could pick to play forever it would be this one. It is so easy to pick up and play for hours. The only other game in the series I would say competes with this is Harvest Moon 64. If a 3DS version was made for that it could beat out this one. Don't waste your money on DS Harvest Moon Games, just get this one.",4.0,B0000A03CT,This is the best Harvest Moon game,Video Games
"Another year, another Madden game on the DS.  This time around though, Madden NFL 08 ends up being the best installment of the long running series to hit the DS yet, with EA making some vast improvements over previous incarnations of the series.  The first thing you'll notice is that the 3-D player models on the bottom screen of the DS are much improved this time around.  That being said, they still might not be a whole lot to look at, but the game does look better in the graphics department this year overall.  The control scheme has also seen some tweaks, as has the overall gameplay and various play modes as well.  Not to mention that the Wi-Fi capability also ends up being one of the best features of Madden NFL 08, and is every bit as fun as it should be.  What really hurts Madden NFL 08 though ends up being the small amount of glitches that plague the overall game.  These glitches appear in the form of the game's graphics engine as well as the opponent AI (which is also quite forgiving at times, but then again, this is Madden after all) and are quite noticable as well.  Not to mention that the play by play commentary is hardly as prolific as what it could be, so don't expect to hear a whole lot from the man himself while you play.  Negatives aside, Madden NFL 08 ends up being the best Madden game to hit the DS yet, and for football fans that own a DS and are craving a more than solid NFL game (like you have any other choice), then look no further.",4.0,B000P0SEPS,The best Madden on the DS yet,Video Games

"***purchased via Xbox Marketplace digital download***

In a console generation that has been saturated with overhype, borderline false advertisement, and rushed games not ready for launch upon release, I have finally found a game that would fully justify a next gen console purchase for those that are on the fence. CD PROJEKT RED knocked this one out of the park despite two substantial delays. In my opinion, the delays are simply a sign that they were not willing to release a product until it was the best it could possibly be.

If you enjoyed Skyrim, Dragon Age, Game of Thrones or even Red Dead Redemption you will likely love this title. You will become quickly immersed in the developer (not procedurally) created world and deep story telling. If you have not been following the studio's behavior pre-release, they have set the standard for proper customer service and how to release a game properly. They did not street date the game until it was ready, distributed review copies well ahead of launch, and even provided multiple goodies in the standard physical editions of the game as a thank you for purchasing. 16 FREE DLC packages have already been announced for the future, but if money is tight you will literally find hundreds of hours of immersion in this game alone.

With the time I have been allotted to play, the story is beautiful, with clear direction and unmatched story telling. What really sets this game apart, is the desire to explore and the wonderful things you find and can do while doing so. Just today (story spoiler free) I was on what I thought to be a small side quest to help a villager find a family member, when on the way back after completion I was ambushed, found intel on one of the attackers that led to a hideout, and then a small boss at that location that led to quite the fight. Keep in mind this was all separate from the main story!

I personally am not a huge fan of RPGs as I spend most of my time in first person shooters, but I can tell this game will likely have my attention at least until the holiday season. CD PROJEKT RED has restored my faith in gaming and a developers ability to make games for the gamer. I highly recommend this title for anyone who enjoys quality games and wonderful stories, and hope that if nothing else you support a quality developer in a market saturated with greed and shady practices. Yes, the resolution is improved on the PS4 and maxed out PCs, but I assure you that my experience with this title on the Xbox One has been nothing short of magical and it is still a gorgeous world to explore.",5.0,B00WTI2HV6,An absolute masterpiece in a console generation filled with disappointment,Video Games
"I was a little skeptical to get this game because, for me, the first one was a huge disappointment. It was hyped up beyond belief and then was a glorified GTA which was not what I was looking for. The story line was also dark and not engaging - I wanted something like the Last of Us and was left with Titanfall.

I'm so glad I didn't let me previous opinion sway me, this game is a blast to play. Looking at graphics and gameplay:

GRAPHICS 10/10
Again, Ubisoft did an incredible job here. Everything from the shadows, your characters strut while holding a gun, to cut scenes, it is all masterfully done. This one of the best graphics you'll see in a game, especially actual game play.

GAMEPLAY 9/10
Giant improvement here. It is still very much like GTA but the improved story gives you a purpose, not to mention a better attachment to the characters. I find myself laughing often as the characters are hilarious. Even the missions are better, not just ""go hack that guy over there"". Just so much more engaging, it can be as linear or open world as you want it to be. One of the subtle changes that I really enjoyed was the use of your cell phone for everything...missions, map, music, and even downloading apps needed for the game.  It really adds to the hacker feel.

CONCLUSION
Whether or not you liked the first Watch Dogs is not important in making a decision to purchase this game or not. The history behind the first one is also not needed.

It's simple, if you're looking for a fun game with top-notch graphics and an enjoyable/funny storyline with characters that are relatable or you can form an attachment to, this game is a must have.

"I was never too into Animal Crossing well, until this game came out. I had played around with the other versions long ago, but they didn't grip me like this. It starts similarly to the others (getting indebted to Tom Nook) and the gameplay is similar, but the fact that it felt like a full home console version of Animal Crossing on a mobile device really helped it for me. I think part of why previous iterations put me off is that the kind of play I would do (daily check-ins) are more conducive to small play sessions in bed, while commuting, during breaks, etc., not necessarily while sitting in front of the TV.

The graphics are great; looks like the Gamecube version shrunk down. Im sure they could be improved, but I think they are in a good spot as they are. This was one area that hurt Wild World a bit (the DS version of Animal Crossing).

The gameplay is pretty simplistic, slow-paced, and relaxing. You have a small set of actions you can do (digging, cutting, catching bugs, planting flowers, etc). The main meat of the game is split between several areas: collecting, customization, bell acquisition, and NPC interaction. For customization, this means placing major landmarks or improvements, pathways, creating custom patterns for various purposes, etc. and performing other duties as the acting mayor. Bell acquisition would be getting fruits from other towns for selling, cultivating gold trees, catching rare bugs. NPC interaction normally results in short quests for you to complete. Collecting is woven into all of these facets (e.g. you can sell fossils or donate them to the museum collection). There are lots of little activities to do each day and the town progresses as you play it.

"I played the demos for this game and it rocks. I saw potential for many mini side quests, a pretty good fighting system and like others have said, you can move while battling. The controls were set up nicely and were easy to use. If you position yourself so that the enemy is in a column or row, you can hit multiple enemies in one strike (so don't bunch up your team. What goes around comes around). It also has skill strikes, level ups, weapon build ups, etc. Yes, it's similar to FF games but it's a great set up. Excellent graphics and sound abound.
The only bad thing I saw is small. They had this big opening with dialog but when you begin your quests and speak to other key people, you're stuck ready text. It'd be nice if you talk to a key person in the game, you could hear it. When you talk to random city dwellers it could be text. This way, you know when you're getting important info.
I'm still rating this a 5 star game because the TEXT issue is a small one. I also have not played the whole game so I can't tell you how long it lasts or if the ending is anything like the beginning but if it is, it should rock.",5.0,B00008W2R8,This rocks,Video Games

"Lots of great action, puzzles and a decent plot make this game addictive.  It has 12 chapters that have you negotiating everything from sewers to a cathedral.

This is an older gamecube game so the graphics aren't perfect and if you're not used to third person games, the movement of the characters can take a little getting used to.  It's not extremely difficult to get through the levels.  I'm pretty much a newbie at gaming and always have to use the Easy mode for everything just to get through.  This game offered enough challenge to not be boring but still didn't seem overly difficult. For just the gameplay value, I'd rate this right up there with the Resident Evil series for Gamecube and Wii.  It is violent and bloody so not for young kids.

"This game feels rushed and unpolished. There are occasional glitches (graphic freezes and graphical anomalies such as your character singing into an invisible microphone) and it just feels like not much work was put into it. It just isn't nearly as much fun as Rock Band, and the pitch recognition in Rock Band is a lot more accurate. The biggest problem with this game is pitch recognition - at the low end of my voice the game just doesn't respond accurately, no matter how I adjust the mic settings. There's also quite a noticeable delay between singing and hearing your voice through the TV speakers, something that is inexcusable for a karaoke game. These are all thing Rock Band got just right, so why is this game so buggy?

The real American Idol judges all provide their voices to this game but the character models look eerily lifeless. You'll quickly start getting repeated comments. While fun at first, the American Idol schtick does start to get a bit tiresome, although thankfully there is an option to just sing without hearing the judges at the end.

On the plus side, there is a good selection of songs (mostly pop/rock) and plenty more to come via downloadable content (42 available as of March 12th 2008). You can customise your characters' costume with loads of outfits and there are quite a few ""venues"" where you can sing. There are a few unlockable videos of actual American Idol song clips and interviews with the judges about the game.

Overall, a bit of a frustrating experience and it is well worth the extra money to buy Rock Band instead (where you get to sing, play guitar and play drums).",2.0,B0010B3PUA,Fairly disappointing.,Video Games

"This is Superman Returns: The Videogame, not Superman Returns: the Movie.  With that said it's only fair to review this game from a videogame's perspective and not compare it to the movie.  Yes, it has some elements from the film, but those elements were obviously too few to make a great game.  And so, the developers wisely added additional elements that are derived from Superman lore, to include 70+ years of Superman history!

I liked the fact that even though Superman is invincible, Metropolis is not. The city takes damage as chaos reigns.  This feature has to be one of the greatest decisions ever made for a videogame.  After all, protecting Metropolis and its citizens from all danger is Superman's prime objective.  And why ask why there are dragons in the city?  Can you say Mister Mxyzptlk?  Anything, and everything thing happens with that guy around.

This game also gives you the ability to save your progress at anytime.  So there is no excuse and reason to start over from the very beginning of a chapter.

Overall the final product is astonishing; this is the BEST superman game ever made.  Ever wanted to be the man of steel? This is your chance!",5.0,B000F1UK3Q,Superman Returns Rocks!,Video Games

It has a bit of a learning curve and a few of the characters on your team are totally useless, but it is a good story, good game play, has a challenging difficulty curve, allows plenty of chances to grind/experiment in between the story, and the fusion and skill rack ability is a really fun mini-game that will really help your team.

Some of the characters are introduced poorly, but they grow on you. Someone really screwed up lo's chest; it looks so silly.

"Bioshock is a beautiful game, a well-polished game, with the production values of a Hollywood blockbuster.  I had a lot of fun playing and beating this game, yet when I was done, I uninstalled it and moved on.  Why?  Bioshock is ultimately undermined by the very thing that makes it good in the first place: its carefully crafted storyline and well-planned first player campaign.

The GOOD: Terrific graphics, especially the water and fire effects.  This game is not lacking for eye candy, IF you have the hardware.  The sound is similarly stunning, and used very, very well by the developers.  The art direction (the whole art deco concept) is masterfully executed.  The concept--alone in an abandoned underwater utopia gone wrong--is also creative, fun, and used to the full extent.  There are some genuinely scary moments, though F.E.A.R is still scarier than this game.  The plasmid powers are the equivalent of magic in Role-Playing games, and the Tonics function like experience points.  The U-Invent machines are a nice touch, though the whole vending machine bit was overdone.  Overall, there are some genuinely fun moments in this game.

The BAD: The story is ultimately pretty weak and trite as well as very, very linear.  At the end I didn't care what was going on, I just wanted to finish the game--that's never a good sign.  There is zero replay value.  I don't care about the lack of multiplayer, but having been spoiled by wide-open, living universes such as Oblivion, the linear, level-to-level design of Bioshock felt limiting and dated.  You don't ever explore Rapture as much as you are guided through it by game designers.  I also feel as if the half RPG/half shooter aspect of the game hurts it.  The plasmid powers are scaled so that you are never really more powerful than your enemies.  That's right, one of the most fun aspects of RPG--leveling up and beating up on baddies--is negated by the scaled difficulty.  The Big Daddy fights are also repetitive as anything, and nowhere near as fluid and inventive as advertised.  The alarms and alarm bots are as annoying as the cliff racers from Morrowind, and a regrettable inclusion on the part of the developers.

BOTTOM LINE:  This is a beautiful game that was very, very well executed.  Yet, as always, the innovation and novelty was exaggerated by the media, and at the end of the day, this is essentially a linear, scripted shooter with a predictable story and some half-baked RPG elements thrown in.  I loved System Shock 2 (the ancestor to Bioshock), and I kept waiting for Bioshock to wow me as much as that game did...",4.0,B000MK694E,"Beautiful, fun... and a bit disappointing",Video Games

"Gave it a 5, based only, on my own prejudice --- I realy like the Family Guy Humor, and this is rated M for good reasons, so it was there.  At first, in the Frat Party level, I was a little put off at how easy that was, but felt the levels and the comedy and the graphics got better as the levels progressed....and the difficulty went up and help keep it going OK.  So my inner and it seems, very immature child, with my love of very non-correct humor, wins out and I give it a 5...(because I could enjoy focusing more on playing and not cursing the game/myself and dying over and over to try and beat a level).....but, if you are not a Family Guy lover, wait for this to slip into the older rack at the local store and pick it up for $10 a year from now.  It is a game you will play with the idea to just waste time and hang out in each level as much as possbile, to find all the characters and see what outlandish things they will say or do.....after that, it wold be a game to sit down and replay for the heck of it, and for the joke element........so, not for everyone.",5.0,B007Z3UUF0,Read before dropping a duce,Video Games

"NBA Live 2006 is crap, that game is just all about dunking and the super powers of the players, the physicas are totally unrealistic. Any time you post up, it usually leads to you getting the ball stripped. For some reason and (I really really hate this) teams have a very hard time getting defensive rebounds in this game. There's nothing like getting a rare possesion in this game where you actually play solid defense and force a missed shot, only to have the offensive player slam dunk it back in your face while the defensive player just stands there like an idiot, which happends every time.

NBA Live 2005 was way way better. I'm already passed NBA Live 2006, but NBA Live 2005 is a classic I still play. There's no real flaws in this game. If you have a dominate big man, then you will dominate the paint and have a good chance of scoring, if they double team, you can find open guys for shots. You need to have an offensive plan and know what kind of team you are. sloppy offense leads to steals and missed shots which lead to fast break chances for the other team.",1.0,B000930DMI,Complete crap!

"Humana partnered with Ubisoft to sponsor three of the workout programs on Fitness Evolved 2012.
~Strengthen Your Heart focuses on high blood pressure
~Active Kids is targeted at preventing  childhood obesity
~Aging With Grace is designed to help the eldery with mobility & agility
As an out-of-shape senior, I'm not spending as much time with this program as I should.  I began with the Strengthen Your Heart program. It tired me out yet wasn't too hard for me to follow. I checked out the Active Kids program which seemed to have some of the same exercises as  Strengthen Your Heart.

I thoroughly enjoyed the Stack 'Em Up game & was fairly successful at catching & balancing the falling shapes. As a matter of fact, I beat my 23 yr. old daughter a few times until she got better & started beating me. My arms didn't get tired at all. I played  for quite a long time.

I was disappointed with Run the World; the graphics weren't at all what I expected them to be. I was expecting to enjoy the sites as I 'fast walked', not ran,  through NYC.  I don't know how to explain  the graphics, just that, they were computer generated, & I wasn't impressed with them. When I passed an important/interesting landmark, etc., a tour guide gave a brief description & a small photo of the landmark popped up on the screen.

I had fun with Wall Breaker & was fairly successful as I punched through walls of bricks & blocks. I'm a wild puncher & really wear myself out when I play these kinds of games. It was fun; even more fun when I beat my daughter a few times.

  This game has several programs to choose from: Body Focus Workouts (these target specific areas, such as arms, abs, back, glutes & more), sports preparation programs,  high energy African Rhythm dance routines, Bollywood (so much fun!), Latin Dance, Hip Hop, Yoga, Cardio Boxing, Boot Camp,  Zen Zone (inspired by Tai Chi & Yoga), and if this list doesn't have enough choices for you...there's more.

"While I think this is a great game I don't really consider it a great mass effect game. I think the game would've been better had they cleaned it up a bit and showed more focus. The combat is completely changed from the first one. It's more action oriented which I don't really have a problem with but it's basically a cover shooter. Everywhere you go there's plenty of cover and it over does it with the corridors. Basically you have sections cut up on the hub worlds. A section to walk around in and talk and do missions. And a section just for combat. I don't like this as it feels like you're restricted and it feels cheap. I much prefer the wide open areas of the first game. Which brings me to another issue is certain places in the game just aren't as good as the first. Remember the citadel from the first game? That's one of the best and most interesting locations for any game ever. But the citadel here is nowhere near as good. The locations are cramped and less inspired it seems than in the first.

Next I have to mention the complete and utter waste of hacking and scanning. These are gameplay elements that could've went to something else. Instead we are constantly hacking and the hacking is pointless because it's impossible to fail and it never evolves. The scanning is equally bad as it just screams a bad and wasted gameplay element. It's essentially a missed opportunity to include something more interesting and worthwhile. There's too much of it and they didn't need to do that. When you have a problem with the Mako from ME1 you shouldn't cut it out for something worse, it should be improved or changed into something better.

Next, the story. The story was executed well enough for what they had but it's very choppy and unfocused. It focuses much more on the characters, who are awesome, but it takes the focus away from the reapers. We get more of a side story that focuses on different things you probably didn't expect it to. It's not terrible, just probably not what you planned on doing in a ME game.

The games strengths are it's characters, it's music, it's side quests, and it's production values. The game takes a noticeably darker approach in nearly every way and that's something that many people will love. My main problem is that it takes a completely different direction from the first. It's much more Hollywood and less of the interesting and awe-inspiring Sci-Fi world that the first game was going for. It's still an excellent game despite all it's problems.",4.0,B001TORSII,While I think this is a great game I don't really consider it a great mass ...,Video Games

"While I give this game points for the absolutely beautiful -and unique- graphics, I just can't bear to slug my way through the entire game.

Let's take a moment to talk about the game's most distinguished merit: Graphics. Now, just because the graphics are my favourite part of this game doesn't mean that you should expect the most ""advanced"" visuals. What is great about what you will see is that you probably haven't seen anything quite like it.

Sure, you've played sidescrollers and seen Japanese-style cartoon characters but screenshots just don't tell the whole story here. The characters have a motion that somehow allows a 2D cartoon character to come alive. Beyond that, there is just an enormous amount of detail poured into the environments that you just don't see in other 2D realms.

That said, there are just a number of flaws that bring this would-be giant to its knees. I'll only focus on the most important: Gameplay. Be prepared to be frustrated. When you first start out, you will be puzzled by seemingly unresponsive button presses. As you play you will learn that presses just don't register while the character is carrying out the current action. What this amounts to is slowly and carefully timing your buttons with the animations, which is incredibly counter intuitive and clumsy- especially when you have five to ten bad guys bum-rushing you at high speed. Your natural tendency is to mash away, which will ultimately result in your demise.

In the end, this game may be worth the bargain price, but only as a whimsical (and short) diversion for those dry spells between major new releases.

Summary:
Beautiful art meets clumsy controls

Pros:
-Absolutely wonderful art and animations
-Unique concept of combining action and RPG elements (albeit not masterfully executed)

-Frustratingly clumsy controls

It has many different levels, so there is no shortage of variety. There are many types of guns and several gadgets. The real fun comes in the form of the driving and rail shooting levels. There is one level that puts you in the driver's seat of an Aston Martin DB5 and you race through the streets of Budapest. Your car comes equipped with all manner of cool weapons including rockets (for taking out enemy cars) and missiles (for taking out enemy helicopters). That level also features a rail shooting area where you are in a Soviet tank armed with a cannon and a chain gun. This is my favorite level of the game.
The regular ""walk around"" levels are pretty good as well. The enemies (in my experience) seem to be a little dumb. You can walk right up behind them and pop 'em off before they even know you're there. Like many shooters you might not feel the need to play it very often, but for the price you'll likely pay, you don't have to feel bad about getting it.
Last word: Agent Under Fire is a fine shooter, in particular if you don't want massive blood and guts. The ""victims"" fall down without any sign of a wound, and disappear in a few seconds. There is a good selection of levels and weapons, and many different things to do after you finish the last level (for example I believe there are other levels you can unlock if you obtain all the ""Golden Rewards"". I'm not sure though.)
I can't comment on the multi-player feature having never played it.",4.0,B00005V3EX,"Quite good. Weak in some spots, but quite good.",Video Games
"The best DS game yet, not just the best DS Pokemon game! The game starts up and there is no time wasting. You get your Pokemon within 5 minutes like Red/Blue, battle your rival, and be on your way!

 The amount of content in the game is insane for a Pokemon game with many of the wifi only Pokemon from Pokemon Black/White, being available without dumb downloads. There are familiar characters, places, and all new areas and a new team of villians to take over the world and are the ones responsible for freezing the land. You can discover the secret of Kyurem and learn of his special ability. You can travel to new cities and areas. The amount they added to the map is almost doubling the original game. It is now flooded with trainers to make leveling up very fast and easy. The new Elite 4 arenas are really cool as well!

 Unlike the other Japanese Pokemon games, I recommend learning some Japanese before playing this game because there were I think 3 places where you actually needed to read the Japanese text. Since this game is region-coded, in order to use PokeTransfer, you will need a Japanese version of a previous game to send them over (Diamond to Black2), but you can trade any region of Black/White to Black2.

"I am years behind on this review but I felt like I should write one, mainly because every other game review I seem to produce on Amazon is either bad or merely decent.

A year or two ago I got my home theater set up and I was trying to decide on which RPG to get into for the 360 (I'm a pretty big RPG fan). Sadly, there isn't a large selection for the Xbox so it didn't take me long to find competition between a few titles. I won't list any other possible selections because I haven't played them, although it should be noted that there are some other RPGs and even JRPGs out there with good or very good reviews as well (as you can see Tales has very good reviews here).

I am a traditional kind of RPG player (I enjoy games such as Final Fantasy 1,6,7, Xenogears, Lunar Silver Star Story Complete, Chrono Trigger) although I am open to anything with a good story, graphics and sound. One of the first things that really appealed to me about Tales is the beautifully crafted artwork. As others have mentioned, the game consists of cell shading, and while the graphics are relatively simple, they remain very vibrant and fun to view. I found the villages very comforting, and even the dungeon-type landscapes were still nice to look at. Also, I thought the camera angles were original and made the experience unique. For example, while running down a stairway, the camera will sometimes follow right behind you, so you really gain a depth of perception into the setting.

The music was also enjoyable. It has been years now since I played it but I still find that I remember many of the tracks. It was also nice on my surround system because some of the background effects (such as running water or blowing wind) were truly surround. Audio is one of the biggest aspects for a game to me and Tales does well in this department, albeit they also play it relatively safe.

Although there is a large open world with a traditional world map, I did find the game in general as relatively linear. Not in pacing or completing missions or the storyline, but in the layouts of platforms and dungeons and paths. What I mean is, everywhere you encounter enemies (other than the world map) is a bunch of small paths in which you take them left or right, up or down. This effect is more easily experienced than explained. However, due to the beauty of the landscapes, I was able to look past this flaw for the most part.

While the villages and environments are beautifully stunning, I found that most of the large cities were not quite as explorable as I had wished. You may enter a few buildings and participate in a few side quests, but for the most part the huge metropolises are pretty much inaccessible for you. While some games I feel present TOO much to explore and other areas of the game suffer for this, I feel as though Tales of Vesperia was shortcoming in variety and being able to really become a part of the settings in which you explore. Sure, there are minute side quests and interactions with NPCs, but I feel that there could have been much more. For example, think of the Gold Saucer in Final Fantasy VII. Well, Tales offers an island in the game much like it, and really, it is more or less an equivalent to the Gold Saucer. Actually, the FF7 recreation area was probably MORE in depth, and it was released in 1997! Of course, Final Fantasy VII was a masterpiece and lives as one of the great JRPGs, but still, Tales of Vesperia released over ten years later. While the graphics may have improved, the overall immersion in the environments was little or not improved from a decade prior. I did, however, become addicted to playing the poker on the island, and it is also a great way to make money in the game.

The fighting is somewhat dissimilar from traditional RPGs in that it is not turn based, and you have the ability to run around a three-dimensional sphere as a combat area. While it is relatively primitive, the battles are rather fun. I like the option of being able to put the other party members on auto, so your healers and magic casters will stand in the back of the battle (hopefully!) and cast as you choose to physically attack (which is what I most often did). There are ""fatal strikes"", which are basically death-blows and they are the most fun thing in the combat to me. And throughout the game, including boss battles, I felt as though the battles were hard enough to be competitive but not horribly unfair. I rather enjoyed fighting many of the big monster bosses, which often were completely optional for the player.

I think the biggest drawback to Tales of Vesperia is the story. It is only good enough to keep you playing, and actually many of the other perks in the game (such as the fighting and artwork) probably kept me playing more so than the storyline. And this is an RPG we're talking about. While I rather enjoyed all of the characters (even Karol!) and all of their dialogues, I felt that the main story was weak and that the conclusion of the game was severely disappointing. All of the ideas that I had in my head about how the game would end came crashing to a halt when I finally completed the game. I think I was looking for more of a dialogue between my characters of which I'd come to love, and in that department Tales pretty much let me down.

There are other aspects in the game (such as cooking, fighting in arenas or finding rare collectibles) that were enjoyable, but again they were pretty much tertiary and did not leave me with a feeling of accomplishment. Cooking for example could have developed into something really fun and novel, but in the end it was kind of a letdown.

Overall, I still rate this game at over four stars. If you enjoy RPGs that are aesthetically pleasing and traditional, Tales of Vesperia is a great choice for you. I actually traded my game in and I wish that I had kept it now, if only to jump on every once in a while and listen to the soundtrack and fight some battles. Namco did a great job with this title and I would look forward to another in the future, as long as the storyline comes off as a little more compelling.",4.0,B0015HZLVA,Somewhere between 4 and 4.5 Stars for Me,Video Games

"There are a lot of things I like about this console and a few things I'm so so on but I do not find them to be deal breakers.

First I'll start with the positives.
This thing handles nes,snes and genesis carts through three different slots on top. As well as supports all the respective consoles original controllers if you wish.

It even has a region switch on the front panel so you could change it to play famicon games or super famicon games.

I personally like the design of this I bought the white/blue one and it just looks sleek. The front panel cover the hides the controller ports is a really nice design feature.

It gives you two snes style controllers which match your color scheme. These hook into the genesis ports but will work on all three consoles. You cannot use an original snes controller on this and have it work with say the genesis games.  You would either have to use the supplied controllers or get a genesis controller.

I can confirm that the super everdrive works with this. I do not own a genesis or Nintendo everdrive but am told those work with this as well.

Every game I have tested on this works. Even unsupported games like bible adventures I was pleasantly surprised work with this console.

Lastly I have hooked this to an hdtv that has composite inputs. This does not look as good as it would on an older crtv but it looks just as good as the original consoles would hooked to my tv and the sound has been just fine. I have heard others complain that the sound was not accurate. I have not experienced this and it could just be I do not have the affected games.

Now the so so's
Firstly the controllers. While these are by far the best clone console controllers I have ever used they are not as good as an original Nintendo or sega controller. For how much this thing costs though, these things are great and most will not have a problem.

The cartridge slots are really tight.  While this is good as it ensures your carts are making a good connection. Removing them or putting them in makes you feel like you're almost breaking this thing.

Lastly the console is very light and definitely feels cheap. But again I reference the price of this thing,  you can't really expect plastic quality to be the same as a current gen system.

To close this up for the under $60 price tag this thing is amazing. I have checked out retrons and this is better. The fact that it is cloned hardware not a system that runs emulators like the retron means you have much more compatibility. If you want the ability to play all those old games that have been sitting in your attic but don't want to go out and buy three consoles and take up that space you really can't do better than the super retro trio.",5.0,B00JQMARO2,You really can't beat this price for what you get.,Video Games

The quality has steadily declined since I took the plunge with Madden 2010. This is the game that made me decide to skip years on Madden. For what it's worth, I've decided to skip NCAA, as well.

"Ok, let me preface this by say that I am not a huge fan of RPG's, but I have played some like the Witcher, which I eventually enjoyed and Oblivion, which I am going to revisit and give it another chance.  This game is no different - it is quite enjoyable and has a good storyline - although there are 2 probs I have with it. 1) had to updated with latest patch to get it to work despite my having a new copy and a sick machine.  2) there seems to be more story/cutscenes than actual game play/fighting.  I didn't mind the car driving, but there was more than I expected, and I haven't even finished the game yet (level 7) I only played this game as I could no longer stand the hype and had to find out what it was all about.  And the game is pretty good as far as games go. but once again, seems more cutscenes than gameplay so keep that in mind. I got this as the Value Edition - same game- diff packaging (more lame)so it was a good vaule at that.

"Plot Summary: Set in between Episodes III and IV, Darth Vader trains you as his secret apprentice with the ultimate plan of overthrowing the Emperor. Vader sends you out to dispose of a few surviving Jedi and in the process, you discover the light side and become aware of the deceptive nature of the sith.

Gameplay: The gameplay gets you as close to the experience of being ""in the movie"" as possible.  Its a third-person hack and slash at its core, however there are some platformer-esque elements integrated throughout. Combat is dominated by lightsaber attacks and combos however ranged force attacks (lighting, grip, repulse, etc...) are also essential to gameplay. Its fun and relatively easy to string together multiple lightsaber combo attacks or use the force to push enemies off of cliffs, etc.  While the gameplay is well thought out and implemented with good effort, there are certain aspects of the combat system that are incredibly frustrating.  First, the camera control (right analog stick) can become burdensome when fighting bosses or large masses of enemies.  Alternatively, you can lock on to a single target (the camera will follow you in combat) however the lock on mechanism fails repeatedly throughout the game.  There were several instances, for example, where I was targeting an object on the wall instead of the boss in front of me.  If you can learn to accept these little annoyances, the gameplay is very fun and very addicting.

Other notes: If you buy the original version of the game (not the Ultimate Sith Edition) you will need to spend $40.00 on downloadable content for the PS3 in order to be able to earn 100% of the trophies for the game. I suggest if you want to 100% this game that you instead buy the Ultimate Sith Edition (3 extra missions)

Overall, this is a great game, especially now that the price has dropped. Hopefully the sequel will address some of the camera/combat issues that aggravate gameplay in the original game.",4.0,B000R39GPA,Addictive gameplay with annoying bugs!,Video Games

"The Sims' House Party Expansion Pack is a good investment if you really like The Sims for what it is and are not expecting any big expansions of game play.  What you do get are some interesting party motifs (Tikki, Country-Western, Rave) a couple of new items and some more group interaction.
Pros: Parties are easier to throw with the mass invite option.  It's much more time-efficient than calling up each individual person, or even using the party balloons.  Several items, like the campfire and bubble machine allow for more group interaction, making maintaining social relationships easier.  They also provide some interesting sound files featuring more SimSpeak (the nonsensical language your Sims speak) and SimSinging around the campfire.  Some practical additions object-wise (like smaller dining room tables for instance, which can replace the behemoths the first pack provided) also are welcome additions.
Cons: as other reviewers said, the game is a little buggy.  My game crashes every so often now, even though it never crashed before with the original or the Livin' Large expansion pack.  It doesn't run quite as smoothly as one would like.  I did take care to prepare my computer thoroughly (running scandisk and defrag) before installing, but I'm still having problems.

"First I preface that I did not play the original PlayStation 2 release so there's no nostalgic point of view going in

Best way to describe the The Legend of Kay is a mixed of Sly Cooper/Jack & Daxter and Kung Fu Panda. Like the Sly Cooper/Jack and Daxter games it's a 3D adventure platformer with battle elements sprinkled in. It has cutesy animal characters similar to those of the Kung Fu Panda films. The plot is pretty generic: gorillas invades the village and oppresses all the other animal races and imprison some of them. Kay stands up to fight them and saves his friends in the process. Even though rated 10+ there are some alcohol references, instead of beer and wine the alcoholic beverage in this game is dubbed nettlemead.

-Gameplay involves platforming, battle segments, light puzzle solving and riding animals.

Platforming is okay if it weren't for the horrible camera angles, where if there's a miss placed jump in a long platforming sequence, you may have to restart from a minute or two back.

Battle sequences suffer from the same problems as at times the camera decides to obstruct your view from what's happening. The battle system involves doing combos, blocking and dodging. The latter of the two requires timing and if you're down to your last life it's pretty frustrating when the camera starts misbehaving out of nowhere. There's no lock-on mode which may be troublesome in the endgame where there are mobs of enemies coming at you and you can't pinpoint an annoying enemy to take out first, this is especially troublesome when the camera decides to fight against you also. Combos are not attack based rather finisher based as dealing a final blow on an enemy activates a combo mode where you have to timed button presses to string attacks.

Puzzles in this game is pretty simple. It either involves pushing blocks, hitting the right trigger sequences or breaking a pile of pots into an arrow to your next destination to name a few. These puzzles are simple and fun to solve. They are not exactly brain teasers as with little thought it's easy to figure out, there was no time where I have to look for an online guide to figure out a puzzle. There are some exploration elements though, so you may have to scour every nook and cranny of the map at times to find a hidden item or switch to progress.

There are animal riding segments where you ride a boar through a timed obstacle courses.

All 4 gameplay elements sets a nice change of pace throughout the game, but the camera issues sometimes kills the mood.

-Voice acting in this game is horrible. You can tell they're reading from a script with no visual stimulants or passion. The conversations are not fluid and you can hear small pause transitions between audio tracks. The script is decent, but the voice actors lacks enthusiasm. The background music on the other hand is very good and catchy at times, wished the voice acting had the same treatment.

-The graphics are surprisingly good, you could tell it's a PS2 era game, but with a nice gloss over it running at 60 frames per seconds with minimal loading screen transitions.

-Extras are okay, you get concept art, videos and sketches for completing. For those on PS4 there are trophies, but there are some missable on the first playthrough as some are event triggered, so best to look through the trophy list unless you plan to play through this game multiple times.

Overall good visual upgrade, but has a very old school vibe to it. If they fixed the camera and re-record some of the voices than it would have been a more enjoyable experience.",3.0,B00TKLFOMY,Old game with a shiny coat of paint on it.,Video Games
"Had I played this game right when it came out I may have been a little more lenient. Instead, I played this right after Red Dead Redemption, big mistake.

Everything Red Dead Redemption did well, GTA IV screws up. The characters are annoying, the endless cell phone ringing and obligations to your friends and girlfriends are distracting. The graphics are boring and uninspired (again I know this game is a bit dated now). The people walking around are just mindless robots and don't actually interact much with the scenery. The map itself is ridiculously boring. Street after street after street, some with tall buildings some with short buildings, oh hey there's Chinatown... Not that they could do much with a downtown NYC atmosphere anyways, just a bad choice of game location.

All of these complaints could be tolerable if the missions were actually fun to play and progressed the story (there was a story?). Instead, you get ""Go shoot pool with Friend... Leave pool-hall drunk only to find your car has been moved down the street and you have to walk extremely slow in circles, drunk, to get back to it"" Fun! NOT

Or how about the countless ""Pick up this car and drive it from point A, clear across the map to point B""

Or my favorite ""Choose which guy that has had minimal affect on the story and your relation to the character to shoot and kill""

Oh and screw up one part of one of these missions and it's back to the other side of the map for you.

All in all the missions were just plain boring. There are so many subplots that you completely lose track of where the end is or what you are ultimately trying to accomplish.

"Die Hard Arcade is one of the GREATEST arcade games in the HISTORY OF EVER.  Seriously.  One of the most fun gaming experiences of my childhood AND STILL TODAY, this game is packed with fun.  From combining button smashes to do SWEET acrobatic moves to stomp baddies, to combining weapons to make flamethrowers, to using crazy awesome weapons like ROCKET LAUNCHERS, BROOMS, and GRANDFATHER CLOCKS, you will get your fill with this adventure.  The one thing hindering people from playing the extent of the game would be getting killed halfway through (as was always my downfall while playing it in the arcade) is easily remedied by playing another minigame a few times to collect enough coins.

It was chock full of atmosphere, the controls were responsive and tight, and the levels reloaded instantly. It is a very mature game in the sense that it features drug use, gore, and graphic violence against humans and dogs. Some people rave about the music, but I thought it was alright.

"Let's start this simple review.

Story Summary:
Haunting Ground is the story of a young 18 y.o. girl named Fiona Belli who has been trapped within the confines of a very scary castle that hosts a few frightful people.  These people chase and harass Fiona in different ways while she solves puzzles, finds key items to progress and looks for ways around the castle.  Fiona is accompanied by a canine companion named Hewie shortly after the game starts.

Gameplay Summary:
Fiona controls very simply.  You move her around with the control stick, she is able to run (but can get tired), and she has the ability to attack (weakly) by kicking or shoving.  There are lots of items in the game, but these are mostly key items for story progression or health/stamina recovery items.  There isn't much else to preoccupy your thought and there are no stats, health/stamina meters or lives to keep track of.  The game has no HUD and there is light background music to accompany your time in the castle.

The game has two states during gameplay:  Exploration and Hiding.  While exploring, you will constantly find yourself being found, and consequently chased, by Debilitas, an employee of the castle who has a child-like fascination with Fiona to a dangerous degree.  While being chased, Fiona goes into a panic at various states with these states ranging from Afraid to Full-Blown Freakout (after which you lose your full control of Fiona).  It is possible to die during these chase sequences, but the game is reasonably forgiving.

Some of the game's puzzles can kill the player if the player is not careful, or if the player does not have a decent level of foresight (in which, you better save quite often).  Saving can be done at clocks in the game, so the player cannot save at any point in time.

My Thoughts:
The game is eerie and spooky, but not full-blown horror.  It's an excellent game if you're looking for a good eerie experience exploring a scary place and getting chased by monstrous enemies, but the feeling of dread is not present in this title.  Unlike Resident Evil, Clock Tower, Eternal Darkness or other horror titles similar to Haunting Ground, the player will never feel truly alone or completely helpless.  This is in part due to Hewie, the dog, constantly being with you and allowing you, as Fiona, to have a reliable attack.  Along with this, various game mechanics, such as training Hewie with the ball, actively work against the fear that the game might have had.  Overall, this is definitely not a horror title that should be missed out on.

With the current prices, Haunting Ground should not be bought at $100+ and I actively recommend trying to find a lucky purchase at $80 or below, but the game is exceptional enough to warrant paying over launch-price for the title.

I give the game a 9/10.

Quick Pros:
 - The AI for Debilitas feels very authentic.  I truly enjoyed seeing him lose sight of me and actively search locations based on my movement, open/closed doors and my previous hiding spots.
 - Training Hewie is a cool mechanic, although perhaps not the most entertaining one.  I thought it was awesome when I realized that Hewie was performing actions more reliably the more I congratulated him on correct actions and scolded him on failed ones.
 - The overall feel, cutscenes, characters, mystery and set design are extraordinary.  Both spooky and beautiful, I loved exploring this castle.
 - Excellent backtracking in the game allows the chase sequences to player out better as well as appropriately adjusting the game's pacing.  Every time I felt that I had hit a point where I wished for a shortcut back to old areas I was rewarded with one.  Excellent level design.

Quick Cons:
 - Being chased can be incredibly frustrating and awkward, with Debilitas being able to find the player easily despite having a good lead on him, and the fact that he can move much faster than the player can.
 - Most of the puzzles are extremely easy, and the game relies mostly on hunting for a specific item to unlock a specific door along with backtracking.
 - The game has sub-par direction.  Once the player opens a few doors allowing lots of backtracking, the game doesn't directly guide the player at any point during the gameplay.  This can be extremely confusing when the next place the player must check is a specific room that has been visited, and cleared, previously.
 - Hewie's companion mechanic, where he chooses to disobey the player unless significant time has been invested into befriending him, can be extremely frustrating while trying to escape chase sequences of getting Hewie to follow / fetch.",5.0,B0007WWYLY,A Simple Review for the Undecided,Video Games

"I didn't want this to be a bad experience for me. I wanted to say this is the greatest product ever. But upon arrival. I checked out the controls to make sure they made it safe. No..my navigation control has something broken, rattling loose inside. Its affecting my gameplay. The motion control won't calibrate right. The crosshairs are always pointing to the right and i have the Sharpshooter so its not a issue with how im aiming or anything on my part. Now LBP i have no issues with, great game. Its when i started playing Killzone 3 that i noticed, ""man, this is quite difficult."" In order to look right and left you have to point you crosshairs all the way toward the desired direction. This is no good when you have multiple enemies unloading on you. Its almost impossible to use Move even on Trooper difficulty. (Normal difficulty) on top if this i had to keep calibrating my control, moving the eye, and switching hands to get a better experience. Calibrating this control is a joke. They have you hold your motion control and spin it in 6 different directions until it ends up in the original upright position you start in. ?? Then you start a game and it asks you to calibrate again by pointing at the eye and pressing the move button. But depending on how your standing and where you point from you end up with a feeling that you didn't do it right. Especially when you hold the control where comfortable and yet Sackboys head is looking toward the ceiling or floor. Its so confusing and im usually good with this type of thing. I tried this out on almost all types of games that are move compatible. From LBP, NfS Most Wanted, Bioshock Infinite, and Killzone. In every game, easy mode seemed like hard mode. Goodluck playing 1999 mode on Infinite with move..HA! I'll purchase Time Crisis and House of Dead because you don't need to navigate through the game it moves for you and all you need to do is shoot em up. Hopefully this gives me the move experience i so desperately wanted. Low budget games play better than high end games? Unfortunately yes..i waited so long to buy this hoping they'd fix all the bugs and make it all better. But i was wrong. Plus my nav control is broken..this wasn't a good buy.

There were some sequences that could I could have been without, but for the most part I enjoyed this game throughly.

"I got this game because I was looking for one that would be equally fun when playing alone or with guests.  This game has fit the bill and then some.

I will admit when I originally picked up this game I was skeptical of how fun it would be.  Described as a 'puzzle/action game' it looked a bit basic in terms of skill level and complexity.  I also worried that it would be something more enteraining for families with young children than twentysomethings.  Happily this game proved me wrong and not only have my boyfriend and I gone through almost all the game play available, his mother also loved it so much she got her own copy.

There are many positives about the game.  The first is that it is addictively fun.  We have played it with many different crowds and have yet to find someone who doesn't enjoy the game.  Most are skeptical at first, but then addicted.  It is an especially good game for newbies to the Wii because the game play is very easy to master and intuitive.  Because of this less time is spent mastering the remote and more on enjoying the game.  It also takes full advantage of the movement and possibilities of the Wii remote so it feels very different than playing a game on another system.

I also appreciated the variety of activities between a single game.  Even though they are all different adapations of Jenga like games they are different enough to keep me entertained for hours.  Each game felt different enough that even when I had made it through most of the levels the subsequent ones never felt repetitive or boring.  There is even an in-game editor so you can build levels on your own, leading to seemingly endless gameplay.

Even though I can usually find some flaw with every video game I've purchased this was not the case with this game.  If anything, I'm wishing it came with more levels so I could play longer.

Overall this is a great game that I would recommend whether you are into single or multiplayer gameplay.  It is a particularly good game if you are new to the Wii system and want something you can master and enjoy quickly.

The map navigation killed this game for me.  Spent so much time trying to follow the map to turn in quests. I saw on the forums that others complained about this too. People were calling them lazy. I might be lazy or even stupid but I just couldn't spend so much time looking for a NPC to turn in a quest. The quest navigation totally sucks.

"I have tried to buy two of these from separate sources, and they came in completely different packaging brand new. Even so, they both had the same issue of the audio cutting out periodically when the cords are moving around, such as if you're wearing them while walking around, as people tend to do with headphones. I'm pretty sure the issue is how they're built and how they're stored in packaging. The cords are super-thin and easily breakable. The cords are then folded at many hard angles inside of the packaging, doubtlessly wearing down the copper wiring inside over the years, meaning that there probably isn't an unopened one of these anywhere that is fully functional. Not to mention they could break pretty easily from getting caught on something or just over time.
It's a shame, because they are the most comfortable headphones I've ever worn. The spring-loaded ear clip holds firm, yet gentle, like a good husband. They come with a built-in microphone, meaning they work for phones. I've seen that Sony still makes (or recently made) headphones identical to these, but they didn't have a microphone. The microphone is the most important part! That and the comfort. Most phone headsets are ear buds, which are crab. Or worse, ear clips that are also ear buds. What is even the point of that?
These headphones are much too unique but I suppose they are now a relic of the past.",3.0,B0015DOMGE,"Great in its heyday, but not built to last",Video Games
"I thought it was going to be a great game when I saw the previews for it and then it got a lot of bad reviews.  So I just decided to wait on the wii u version and get the 3ds one.  The movements on the 3ds version were a lot smoother than previous sonic games which were often very stiff IMO.  That along with his new moves, running up walls and the return of the spin dash made the gameplay seamless and complete.  Many of the levels on the 3ds were like mazes giving you a lot of options for exploration which was great unless your searching for red star rings.  The 3D levels were the best I've played on a sonic game ever something you just have to experience yourself.  The 2D levels were good with sonic but seemed to be designed for super sonic.  It has an online multiplayer race which can be very competitive and fun.  Every level in multiplayer can be mastered making the levels fast paced and fluid.  The overall game was actually very fast paced at times not much slower than previous sonic games IMO.

So some people suggest that the 3ds version is the better version.  I found them both to be unique.  The wii u version was definitely slower paced and more deliberate overall but just as rewarding.  The wii u version seems more like a game you would play after a long day at school or work just to relax.  Although there were several paths you can take for each stage like in previous games they were not mazes like on the 3ds.  I often used the spin dash on the 3ds where as on the wii u it's something that was more optional or for intermediate players.  The graphics were good and often had me going ""Ooooh shiny"".  I found the cutscenes to be boring on the wii u than on the 3ds, often just skipped.

Overall I'm very satisfied with both versions and would say that this is the best sonic game since the genesis era.  They finally got it right.  One thing I can say is if you don't care for the wii u version don't count out the 3ds one.",5.0,B00D41GCVS,"Quick Comparision, Wii U Vs. 3DS",Video Games

"Is this a bad game?  No.  Not really.  It does what it promises.  It offers real time strategy gaming the same way all the other AOE games did.  Nothing new here.  Same type of gaming.  Different settings and civilizations.

The main problem with this game is that it is really dated.  It just looks old.  The graphics are poor.  The movement of units is clunky.  Combat is uninspiring and looks just the same as it did in the original AOE games.  Navigating the map is a bit awkward at times.

Simply put, this is an outdated game.  It will offer you very little that is new to enjoy.  BUT . . . if you loved all of the other AOE games, you HAVE TO buy this.  It is well-done from that perspective.  An AOE fan will appreciate this game.

"Unlike the first game, Mystery Case Files: Ravenhearst, Return To Ravenhearst adds the genre of adventure to hidden object and puzzle.
This game is darker than the first Ravenhearst game. You come to free Emma's soul. You discover Charles has abducted Rose and her twin girls. Now you must free them.
On Amazon both Ravenhearst and Return are rated 10+. I would have thought Return would have been older cause it's darker-Charles has abducted four females (Emma, Rose, and her twins) and imprisoned them. With that said, most kids today won't even bat an eye or perhaps know what the graphics imply. The credits show outtakes of the actors much like Jackie Chan shows in the credits that the action in his movies is not real; it's make believe. This makes me feel better about the darkness of this game and young kids playing it.
You move through scenes rather than using a map. You find objects that you use on devices later.
Puzzles are good. Graphics are great. Soundtrack is what I call Movie Music, full blown score. I like the music.
I've had to use walk throughs a couple of times. I skipped a couple of the puzzles that I found very frustrating.

"I've been a long time fan of LSL & have played the games since I was about 12 & snuck onto my dad's computer. I was overjoyed to see that there was going to be another outing for this series & was looking forward to it, even when I heard that the series was not going to surround our favorite hero, Larry. However when I actually played the game I was incredibly dissapointed.
Unlike it's predecessors, the game is entirely a series of minigames instead of the point & click first person interface of the previous ones. That wouldn't have been so bad except they were the same exact mini-games that repeated with each character you pursue. The plotline was actually pretty watered down for a LSL release & was obviously missing the signature Al Lowe humor that made the previous ones so popular. There were some funny moments in the game (such as the 'Summer Loving'-esque song in the gay bar), but they were few & far between. Ultimately I was glad that I'd rented it for my PS2 instead of actually buying it.  I have to say that I didn't entirely expect it to be great when I discovered that it was due for the PS2 as well as for the computer, but I didn't expect it to be as terrible as it was.

"I love the assassins creed series. Mostly II brotherhood and revelations. ACIII was fun, I enjoyed it. However, I had some serious issues.

First of all glitches. I had to reload so many times. Connor is a moron. Carrying two of the same handgun is impossible due to glitches with certain pistols spawning in your holsters every loading point. I had desyncronize all the time to restart missions due to fialing misson ques.

Firearm fails. Okay, so the most powerful pistol would be the Italian flint lock, barrel length is the leading factor in high muzzle velocity, not name or exterior decor. The flintlock musket would outrange all the pistols by double the distance. Less maybe the italian flintlock. Double barrel pistols have two hammers on either side. Not one that magically recocks and re primes itself. The duckfoot was correct. I tend to have a field day in video games with firearm fails.

Conner sucks, a lot. At first I liked Conner, native American badass, son of a Templar. But as the story progressed, I hated him. I wish haythem killed Connor, I liked haythem. He should have had a change in heart or something. Then I would have been happy. Conner is a immature, lacks assassin values and seemed more like a robot than a man. I disagreed with a lot of his decisions. He reminded me of terminator. No heart in anything he did. Ezio was amazing. He was funny and heroic, I always loved it when he won! He was the boss.

Desmond was annoying and fail. I would had been happy if they allowed more free roaming of new York in modern times. Also, the roaming of the wilderness outside of that end of the world tomb. It all felt boxed and too pre determined. All you do is walk into cut scenes.

I liked hunting, that was fun. I wish the bow was more detailed. Custom arrow heads would have been nice. Like a rope arrow, poisen arrows, flaming arrows and armor piercing would have been cool. Also maybe customizable projectiles for guns. assassins should be at a higher technology base than the average citizen.

"Summer's here and there is a lack of FPS games.  At first I was hesitant to purchase Singularity, but I'm glad I did!

The gameplay is your standard FPS fare, nothing new or boundary pushing in Singularity.  The story is interesting, I like the sci-fi elements.  There are too many ""war"" FPS games out there so Singularity fills the void nicely.

Over the course of the game, you receive a Time Manipulation Device, or TMD.  As you play, your TMD is upgraded with powers such as slowing down time, reverting enemies into creatures that go on a rampage, picking up and throwing objects around the environment, and using TMD power as a thruster to knock back and harm enemies and objects.

I like the variety of enemies in this game.  You have Russian troops coming after you as well as different types of mutated humans as a result of the explosion and E99.  Enemies use a variety of weapons and the mutants can throw exploding barrels at you.

The graphics in the game are average, similar to the ""war"" type FPS games where objects and textures appear somewhat blurry/pixelated when you stand next to them.  It's nothing serious and it didn't affect my enjoyment of the game at all.

There are a number of different weapons, your standard rifle and shotgun, pistol, grenade launcher (with a remote controlled rolling bomb secondary attack), sniper rifle, and more, I don't want to give away everything.  Each weapon's clip capacity, reload speed, and damage can be upgraded twice using weapon kits you find in various places around the levels.  First level upgrades require one kit, 2nd require 2.

Scattered everywhere in the game is E99, an element used in everything in this alternate reality.  You collect various containers of it and it's used as a currency to purchase different upgrades such as carrying more health packs, using health faster, longer sprint, more oxygen for swimming, extra weapon precision, and what not.  These different upgrades must be found on blueprints around the levels.  They are generally easy to spot but there are a few that you may pass by.

Overall Singularity is an extremely underrated game.  I'm sad that it hasn't sold more copies because Raven is a good developer.  I thought that by sharing my opinions of the game, I can sway people to check it out.  I've put about 8 hours into the game and I'm not finished yet.  I still have another chapter and a half or so.

"In 2006 when the first Gears of War came out on the 360, it was one of the highest and most popular selling games. This highly anticipated sequel picks up six months after the events of the blockbuster original Gears of War. However the sequel completely outdoes the original in so many ways with major enhancements, Epic Games didn't disappoint. Such as more weapons, bigger vehicles, and more action. The enemies are more dangerous, and the total experiences in both campaign and multiplayer is more immersive than ever. The new revolutionary tactical combat system, will challenge you depending on the four different difficulty, casual being the easiest and insane being the hardest difficulty, you choose to devise a strategy that will work against the incredible enemies who exhibit smart AI. Combined with the sweeping visuals and evocative locales of Sera, where the story takes place, Gears of War 2 offers jaw-dropping graphics that are made possible through advances in Unreal Engine 3 just for the xbox 360.

The limited edition version has everything you would ever need with features including several extras, including a Collectible SteelBook DVD case, ""Beneath the Surface: An Inside Look at Gears of War 2 including some of the original trailers and some samples of the soundtrack,"" a 48-page hardbound book with exclusive art and a foreword by Design Director Cliff Bleszinski. You also get an exclusive gold-plated Lancer Assault Rifle that you can use during online play as well as an additional 5 new well detailed multiplayer maps that can be unlocked via xbox live which brings more bang for your buck.

A fantastic game with a solid and polished campaign along with a fantastic memorable experience with multiplayer, with endless replay value making you wanting you to finnish the game more than once. It also consists of fantastic bonus features and material, so don't miss out on this summer's blockbuster masterpiece.",5.0,B0014CFO4K,One of the best titles out for the 360,Video Games
"You start out on a random planet, weak, injured & with a disabled ship. You choose what to do next. You search the planet to regain strength and repair your ship. This is how the game starts. From what I understand, you, your ship & the planet you are on is randomly generated and different for each player.

PROS
+ Beautiful world. Colorful, full of plants, caves, creatures. The world is endless. This game will never end!
+ Massive area to explore. I see no end to the vastness of this world.
+ Interesting, upgradable character, weapons & ships.
+ Slowly progressive story-line. Very open.

CONS
- At first, it's quite unclear what exactly to do. But that is the style of the game. You will slowly discover the tools needed to progress.
- Sometimes save points are not often enough. You could spend hours searching and just walking around without a save. You can save when you enter & exit your ship and when you find little save tower things.
- The idea of the game is simple. Due to this it can get repetitive.

The graphics are decent, they were going more for style than wow factor. The control is solid and over-all the joy of the game is to simply enjoy exploring at your own pace. This game is massively huge and will take you forever to complete, if there ever actually is a foreseeable closure to the game.

The save feature is the only downfall to this game. I see myself simply putting my PS4 into suspend mode to basically pause the game. However as the game does have many online features, I may get kicked out. Time will tell. I have kids and work, so I cannot dedicate hours upon hours to play non-stop. This save feature may cause issues and may deter me from even playing as I know I could potentially play for an hour then end up losing everything I just did if I cannot locate a save point or get back to my ship quick enough.

Time will tell how the game evolves as I play, but over-all I'm really enjoying. It is very relaxing at times as the score is naturally peaceful and the visuals are fun & stylistic.

Highly recommended!",4.0,B00ZQB28XK,"Fun, Stylistic Adventure Game. Massive!!!",Video Games

"I didn't find this game all that rewarding.  I understand that at 30 years old I am likely not the key demgraphic, but for all the hype I didn't think it delivered.

Gameplay: rather repetitive. the levels were a mixed bag varying from boring to mildly amusing.  There just isn't enough substance here to make it worth while.  Then it seems like you are doing the same thing over and over.  My 9 year old kid enjoyed it just a BIT more than I did, but he moved on from it very quickly, and has never really looked back, opting for games with more substantial playability.

Creation Tool: not powerful.  Of course, After spending 4 months last year creating levels for Little Big Planet, I may be somewhat spoiled in terms of level creation.  Nonetheless, I found the editor to be unintuitive and difficult to control.

"This on-rails shooter serves as an immediate prequel to EA's critically-acclaimed 2008 release Dead Space, which put the player into the magnetic boots of deep-space engineer Isaac Clarke, whose routine repair mission to the planet-cracker vessel U.S.G. Ishimura turned out to be anything but routine.

In Dead Space extraction, the player assumes control of several different characters from the colony on Aegis VII, starting with the removal of the infamous Marker, which caused all the undead mayhem to begin with. Within minutes, most of the colony has begun to experience homicidal delusions, mutations, and an inexplicable urge to grow giant talons and rip former mates apart. The game follows a group of four survivors who attempt to find safe refuge aboard the Ishimura, which as we all know was an epic fail.

Graphics: $9

Considering that this is the Wii, they did a decent job of re-creating the colony and the ship, almost as if the used the same ""blueprints"" from the original game. You get to visit lots of familiar locales from the original game, but from a decidedly-different perspective (""Wait, there's not supposed to be a wall there...Oh.""), as well as lots of new places. Visuals are a decent port from the PS3/360 versions.

Sound: $10

Good voice acting, especially from one of the familiar characters from the first game. I love the Alien-inspired orchestral score and the eerily-silent vacuum of space.

Gameplay/Controls: $7

Controls are good and responsive, and act within the same ""always vulnerable"" context as the first game (i.e., no pausing the game to access inventory, etc.). Auto-fire is my only beef for the controls, as turning the remote 90 degrees for the plasma cutter is not as easy as it sounds in the middle of a heavy fight.

Regarding gameplay itself, I have never been a huge fan of on-rails shooters, with the exception of a few like Space Gun, Steel Gunner and T2 (yes, a licensed game that wasn't total crap). This is because if you can't pick something up at a specific moment (due to your being, you know, mauled by a slasher at said moment), you cannot TURN AROUND and go back to get it. I can't tell you how many times I yelled at the TV to turn the... heck around to go back and get some badly-needed ammo, or to get in the... stinking airlock. But they at least give some limited freedom of movement and the ability to grab things via kinesis, which at least mitigates the problem.

There were also a few clipping issues during a few boss battles (and yes, I was aiming for the limbs). That, and the camera can sometimes give you motion sickness.

Genre: $7

Like the original game, this one is a hodge-podge of borrowed ideas. Music from Alien/Aliens. Combat system similar to Resident Evil. Improvised weapons a-la Army of Darkness. The first-person perspective of this game is used very successfully in creating a sense of isolation, loneliness and, of course, mortal terror of an impending evisceration. Strategic dismemberment works in a shooter, too.

They also do a great job of filling in all the backstory, and take you by surprise several times. The ending actually tops the one from the original game.

Fun: $8.50

The above-mentioned issues notwithstanding, the campaign still manages to provide lots of frights and satisfying kills. Not concerned about a One-Gun achievement, I was able to become better acquainted with the Ripper and Force Gun. Cackling ensued.

Replay/Value: $6

So, now I'm done with it. I could go back and re-do it for more achievements and unlockables, but... I just ate, and I don't really want to. The campaign was relatively short but satisfying.

Bottom Line: $47.50 out of $60 ($40 out of $50 for the Wii)

Again, not a full-price game, but lots of fun the first time through. If I could go back and re-grade the original Dead Space, I would give both games 4 stars. The original definitely has the edge in replay and technical attributes, this one has it on atmosphere and combat.

I await Dead Space 2 with great excitement.",4.0,B001TOMQVC,"Fun, with the help of a little dramamine...",Video Games
"I know I won't get many ""helpful"" votes for this, but this piece of art (as it is not an actual game) isn't worth the current price as of 1/16/06. It's far too limited and option-less; unfortunately, that's probably the point.

In Electroplankton, there are ten different electroplanktons to toy with, all of which create nice, experiemental sounds that are vaguely musical. It's fun for about thirty minutes (not to mention breathtaking) but you'll turn it off with little reason to turn it back on again. When you do, it'll be for five to ten minutes tops, each time.

You won't have a problem with this. It's a program that's designed for minor play, as there's really not much to do.

Fortunately, it sounds amazing and looks really beautiful. Everything is 2D (of course) but it's done in such an artsy, colorful way. It's definitely something for both your eyes and ears.

There will be moments when you'll get a happy accident. Many moments. And every time, you'll wish you had a way to save it on the cartridge. And you simply can't. (Sure, you can save it via output to a computer or a tape/mp3 player, but this seems a bit unnecessary, as the average video gamer probably doesn't have said equipment. Not to mention that something would be ""lost"" without the visuals).

It's an open-ended experience, and while it's an interesting idea, something inside of me wishes there were simply *more* of it. Specifically, more electroplankton. After playing through all ten, you'll quickly get an understanding of which three or so are your favorite, and the couple that you don't like will probably never be played again. Twenty electroplankton would have been excellent.

But, it is what it is: art. It's futile to attach some ultimate score for something like this; art is subjective, therefore someone can think Electroplankton is absolutely brilliant and someone can think it's absolutely not. I happen to fall somewhere inbetween. It's good, but not good enough for the price. Personally, I think it'd be a good idea for you to wait until it's either cheaper or used copies are available.",3.0,B000CI8EXA,not exactly worth the full price..,Video Games

"Congratulations: You found the GameCube version of Blood Rayne. Yep, it's still available...
If you're one of those gamers who are looking for more blood and gore, you're going to find it here. The game takes place in the 1930's, but if Agent Bloodrayne is still alive (this may be just a game, but there is no proof that she doesn't really exist) and has a Gamecube herself, she's probably be hopping mad that this version got short-changed. When I played an X-Box demo, I noticed some things there that were missing from the GC version: extra textures on Rayne's costume and darthish (work with me here, people!) voices to match the slow-motion.  I don't know about the extra textures, but you don't need an X-Box to slow the speed of someone's voice (play TUROK on N64 with a Big Heads cheat).
+ Female Hero; lot's of blood; Nazi-killing (if you're not a neo-nazi gamer); Rayne says ""F--k"" on a Nintendo console; Rayne's outfit; cheat codes; nice tunes (they're in there, you just have to listen carefully)
- faulty controls (you have to press the shoulder buttons in until they click to get any response); lack of control options; can't rescue Jewish prisoners; can't fight Hitler; Rayne's lines can get repetative; missing textures from X-Box (and possibly PS2) version.

"This game isn't as fun as the console's but if you want to play dynasty warriors on the go than this is the best choice. Its ok but its got a different style of gameplay than the console versions. You go into these things called liberation battles, and just travel around a map going to liberation battles, taking over a area, until you occupy the whole thing than you just go onto the next big map and do it again.

  I liked this game because the dynasty warriors series is my favorite series of game for the ps2 and I always thought of how awesome it would be to be able to take it on the go with me practically anywhere i was.

"I was looking forward to this game but it's a ""Farcry"" from anything I was expecting (I know, probably the 100th time that was used).

Do you want to know what this entire game is? Get a mission, drive across the map, kill. Get a mission, drive across the map, kill. Okay, okay...Sometimes you gotta blow something up, after you get done killing. And most of the time you gotta kill guards at check points to get to your mission...The same guards you just killed on the last mission. And the driving blows after a while, boring.

Thing is, it's the same thing over and over and over and over and....You get the point.

You are supposed to be hunting this arms dealer named the ""Jackle"" to STOP him from arming two factions so they stop killing each other right? So what do your missions entail? Simple, you get a mission from one faction,  and it's to kill the other and viseversa. Wait, I thought I was supposed to help them to stop killing each other...But to do so, I gotta kill them? Hundreds of them?!?!

I don't think I'm gonna finish this one because I already know the ending and here it goes. The Jackle ends up in the unemployment line and on food stamps because he has no one to sell guns to anymore because I freakin killed them all! At least thats how I assume its going to end.

Now, for the positve. The graphic are pretty dam impressive at max settings. The physics are great and attention to detail is very cool. But see this is the problem...You have AWESOME programmers and HORRIBLE writers.

The writers really need to be replaced with people better suited to dream up games...It's like a hot rod with every thing under the hood to blow every one away, but the driver is a doof. Can't blame the mechanics.

And want to dominate this game? Use the Spas12, get in close and you will annihilate every one. Why? Because 20 rounds from an AK-47 into the chest of a tank-top wearing bad guy isn't enough to bring them down. Can you say ""WTF""?

"The Razer Mamba Tournament Edition grabs my attention ever since Razer announced it. Finally able to get one for myself, I received mine yesterday. The gaming mouse looks, and feels, very much like my Deathadder Chroma. The RGB lighting is gorgeous, and the overall performance is amazing.

PROS:
1) The Gaming Performance
= The Mamba TE performs very well during my gaming sessions. I experienced no tracking issues whatsoever and the grip and texture of the mouse makes it very comfortable for long term use.

2) The Comfort
= The gaming mouse is one of the most comfortable mouse I have ever used for gaming (and also for general use), apart from the Deathadder Chroma. The top surface texture is very nice to to the touch, and the side grips improves the overall comfort of the mouse.

3) RGB Lighting
= One of the most prominent features of the Razer Mamba TE is the RGB lighting. I have to say, the lighting is simply amazing. It is both bright and colorful, and I can easily customize and configure the lighting settings through the Synapse software. My favorite would have to be the wave effect, as it makes the mouse looks absolutely stunning.

4) The Build Quality
= The mouse has a very premium feel to it, and the build quality is great. It is pretty lightweight and sturdy.

CONS
1) Response Issues
= Sometimes the scroll wheel will bug out and will be unresponsive. When I first started using it, the left click does not register at all. However, all the performance issues are settled whenever I updated the firmware of the mouse through Synapse. No more issues afterwards.

In conclusion, the Razer Mamba TE is one of the best gaming mouse in the market, along with the Deathadder Chroma. Personally for me, the Deathadder Chroma is ever-so-slightly more comfortable than the Mamba TE. Performance-wise, they are very close to each other, both being extremely responsive.

"My Japanese Coach should be thought of as a fun and loose way of practicing writing and vocab alongside a more serious study program, but certainly not as a method of learning by itself. The lessons found in the game are numerous, but they never go into enough depth to adequately teach anything in particular; in a Japanese course textbook, an entire page or so would be dedicated to these concepts with various example sentences demonstrating different usages and workbook assignments would test the student's ability to use the grammar in a practical way.  In this game, the general approach is to say ""ga means 'but,' desu means 'is'"" and then move on.  There are only occasionally example sentences, and only for one or two of the ten words in a given lesson.

The games used to practice are also very questionable, with some of them being clever memorization aids while others are fairly useless wastes of time.  The most straightforward games are usually the best- flash cards, multiple choice, and character tracing/writing are all helpful in memorizing new material, but these games generally just focus on single words or characters and don't teach you much about using them in the context of full sentences.  Many of the games that do present the player with full sentences to fill in generally waste their potential by using romaji instead of kana, something no decent textbook would force students to do aside from maybe the first lesson.

The biggest problem with the game is that it's riddled with errors in its stroke orders, which unfortunately undermines the greatest appeal of having a touch-screen based Japanese guide.  Many of the hiragana, katakana, and kanji are taught incorrectly and often times the player is forced to write them the wrong way in order to proceed.  This is an annoyance to those who already know how to write the correct way, but it's genuinely problematic for those who are learning the characters for the first time, as they're likely to develop a habitual way of writing that may be hard to break in the future.  When the characters are correct, the tracing games are actually a great asset and may be the very best thinkable way to practice writing in Japanese, but the mistakes made by the developer render this moot.

Overall, My Japanese Coach is an entertaining way to pass some time and reinforce one's studying of the language, but it can only really be a helpful aid if one is already studying in a more in-depth manner.  Without a solid basis to work from, the lessons in this game will make little sense and the player will reach the end of the game feeling as if they haven't really learned much of anything aside from random, rarely usable vocabulary.  Alongside an actual course program and a textbook like Genki, the game's value grows dramatically as the player will then be able to understand the lessons more clearly.  Even so, the writing errors and hit-or-miss games prevent My Japanese Coach from being much more than a fun diversion.",3.0,B001BZ8EX8,A decent but flawed study aid for students,Video Games

"My favorite game in recent times was COD4, but Crysis:Warhead is just a bit better than COD4 in my opinion.

I really was just expecting to see Crysis all over again, but Warhead really has a lot of realism that I've not experienced so enjoyably in other games.  The game is more fluid... none of the ""you can't jump on top of that rock eventhough it's only 2 feet high"" limitations.

The graphics are the most realistic I've seen, but still needs a little system adjustment.  Running two 9800's and still have to run at slightly lower settings with DX10.  There is a way to force DX9, but overall the graphics are killer.

This game has many surprises in it that serve to make you feel like you are in another part of the world, but not a fake one.  Things like the sea life and the birds running around on the beach are just small examples of effects in this game that are so life-like that you may catch yourself forgetting you are playing a game.

If you can deal with those two things, however, I highly recommend that you get this game. I played the other two GBA Castlevania games, and this seems to be the best so far. It has a good plot (for a video game), it has over 300 special abilities to collect and trade with your fiends, er, friends using the GBA link cable, and it is a rare action/adventure/RPG/platformer game, which tends to add up to a good game. The gameplay is fun and action-packed, the RPG elements include multiple weapons, from pocket knives to lances to the traditional Castlevania rope to even a hammer for some reason, as well as various types of armor to increase your defense and power.

"Gears of War 2 simply is a game that must be played by any 360 owner who enjoys shooters of any flavor. Whether you love the over-the-top craziness that is Halo or if Rainbow 6 is more to your liking, there is much to be found here in Gears 2. While keeping the gameplay that every Gears fan knows and loves intact, Epic has managed to improve on the things that needed improvement, wiped out almost all of what pulled the first game down, added lots of new features that only add to the experience while literally take nothing away, nothing, and managed to expand upon the admittedly fairly simple characters.

Seeing as how the letdowns are very minor, I'll just get those out of the way now.

1. It's still easy to hit cover you don't want to hit, although this is much improved. I went from constantly hitting cover I didn't want in almost every single round to doing it maybe once or twice a match, and saying it happens four or more times per match is being absurdly ridiculous.

2. The ""three downs and you're out"" rule is still in effect in Execution, even there is NO mention of it anywhere in the tutorials or the game description - the game just tells you to get a one-shot kill or an in-close ""execution"" on the enemy.

3. The single player gives the player a ""crutch"" on Casual - if you fall in Solo, you can be helped up, but no such luck on harder modes, if you fall, you die. I can understand Epic wanting to ease the player in but that is already very easily accomplished with the bucket loads of ammo and the limited damage an enemy does. Having this put in only to take it away on a harder mode is needless.

4. The Multiplayer bots are STUPID. I actually had a match where it was down to one enemy and I had all four of my bots alive, yet their idiocy led to the one killing off all four of them one at a time. And sometimes the last enemy will be down but they won't rush in to finish them even if the clock is on its last 10 seconds. They're not completely worthless but they're not completely reliable either.

5. If a friend is down next to a weapon, for some reason the game will force you to pick up the weapon first, then help up your friend.

6. The Endor, I mean, Reaver level could've been better, or just scratched and used as a cutscene. Hopefully Gears 3 will be without this.

7. For reasons I cannot even begin to comprehend, Epic forces the player to have a completely different weapons setup for the fight with Skorge. And they don't give you your original layout after that and the following section are finished.

Update: The many glitches that brought the gameplay in multiplayer down have been destroyed. For details, search ""Gears 2 Glitches Fixed"" without the quotes.

However, all of these gripes even put together do not in any way shape or form diminish the game at all. AT ALL. Suffice it to say that Epic has smashed all expectations, and given how high they were, that is saying something. The new Gears, despite the cynical, self-righteous jaded players insist, is NOT just the same game with a ""2"" behind it. As they were supposed to do, Epic has added much, such as chainsaw dueling, mobile cover, new multiplayer modes, new maps, (some of which have new hazards to look out for) new weapons, the heavy machine guns can overheat now, and while this isn't saying much, the storyline delves into the characters, especially Dom, a little bit more deeply, emphasis on the ""little bit."" We're only given a hint of Dom searching for his wife in the first game, and that story line comes to the fore later in this game, although it does NOT take anything away from the overall conflict. The plot twist towards the end probably could've had a little more of a punch to it but it's not terrible in any way, and the ending will leave the gamer to wonder what will happen now, especially if they're patient enough to wait out the credits.

The chainsaw duels are simple - Just tap B! but there's tension that you feel leading up to the outcome, which makes winning it feel really good. An enemy can interfere, but that's what teammates are for.

Speaking of teammates, rely on them. Use them to help you. Communicate. Stick to cover and help your buddies out. Teamwork, communication and cover are key. Fail to use one and you'll probably lose. Fail to use two and you will lose. Don't use any of them and you've already lost before the match has even started. Now that being shot slows you down, gone is the chance to rush in shotguns blazing and Rambo your team to victory. Try that in Gears 2 and your only reward is to watch the entire match through spectator camera, which is much improved by the way. Now you have to see to it that concrete, not air, is between you and the bullets if you want to have a chance at winning the match. So stick with your teammates. You win as a team, you lose as a team.

Mobile cover makes its debut and is a smashing addition. In Gears 1, there was only about one way to get mobile cover - be in front of someone who's taking the bullets. Now there is a heavy shield and the chance to take hostage enemies that are downed. Either one will work, although the latter will deteriorate as it soaks up damage and slows you down. The shield will prevent you from mantling and rolling but running is still there. Given just how important cover is in this game, being able to move around with it is good.

I won't delve much into the new modes as the game does a great job of walking the player through how each mode works. Guardian is a great twist on the VIP type of match, even better than Assassination. Submission is a great twist on Capture the Flag, Wingman is very chaotic, perhaps about as chaotic as Gears gets, given the number of small teams, King of the Hill hasn't changed the formula but why fix it if its not broken and Horde is a lot of fun, especially with people who will work together to keep everyone alive. Execution, Warzone and Annex are still the same.

The maps are easy to memorize and suit both sides well. Neither side has a positional advantage regardless of which spawn point they begin the map on. Most are symmetrical and all are small so players will always have plenty of action quickly on in a round and investigating a map to flush out the final enemy doesn't take too long. The maps called Avalanche, Security and Hail have environmental hazards that are just as deadly as an enemy, so a novice would do well to find out how to avoid these so as to not die needlessly.

The Flamethrower, Ink Grenades, an automatic pistol, a mobile heavy machine gun, mortar and the aforementioned shield help round out Gear's already robust weapon roster and any of these can be removed or changed if a player doesn't like them. The Ink Grenades are basically poison, throw or set it and an enemy (or friend!) will continually take damage as they remain in the affected area. Smoke grenades now stun an enemy. As said before, heavy machine guns will overheat, so while mounted ones have unlimited ammo, this helps balance them out. The mobile variant, however, still has a limit, but again, you can move around. Slowly. Speaking of moving around, another MUCH APPRECIATED feature is the ability to crawl when the enemy has downed you in multiplayer. In the first game, if you were downed, you had to stay in place and hope someone would come get you before the enemy finished the job. Now you can close some of the distance between yourself and a teammate, which can mean the difference between winning and losing a match.

And thankfully the sniper rifle's active reload does NOT automatically down someone in Gears 2. Epic got smart and decided to make it so that if your character has full health, an active will damage your character enough so that one more hit will down you. Why on earth they didn't do it this way in the first place is beyond me, but THANK YOU Epic for fixing this needlessly frustrating gameplay element. There are few things more annoying than being killed by a sniper who doesn't have the skill to properly use their weapon. It takes no skill whatsoever to down someone this way. In the first game, all you'd have to do is get another active and down the enemy two more times to kill them, since after getting up the player has to wait a moment before moving (again Epic, WHY DID YOU DO THIS?) So again, Epic, thank you for not allowing such a cheap and frustrating gameplay element poison a great multiplayer experience two games in a row.

Well, I think that about covers it....Oh wait, that's right, the story. Epic still isn't getting high marks for a stellar storyline, but let's face it - the game is about war and the characters have bodies that steroid users can only wish for. Marcus is still the gruff meat head who sounds like gravel is grinding in his throat, Dom is his more level-headed friend who wants to find his wife, Cole is still the hilarious but excellent soldier and Baird is still the whiny sarcastic jerk who will remind everyone that he's the only one who knows how to fix things. Adding onto the roster is Tai, a spiritual warrior who prays as well as he shoots, Benjamin Carmine, Anthony Carmine's (from the first game) brother and Dizzy, who quickly shows just how one-dimensional his character is in about the first five minutes you meet him but is still funny enough to deserve to be in the next game. With the exception of Dom, none of the characters really grow or change throughout the second game, but then again, this is Gears we're talking about. In these games storyline simply does take a backseat to the gameplay, and the gameplay is solid.

And parents, DO NOT, I repeat DO NOT let the Mature rating prevent you from letting your child at least rent the game, because in another stroke of genius, Epic has given you the ability to filter out the language and/or gore.

All in all Gears 2 is a great game and I would strongly recommend it. There is much to be found and loved by the whole gaming community. If you haven't played the first Gears yet, there's little reason to bother getting it first, as Wikipedia can fill the player in on the storyline. In all honesty, had I known beforehand that Gears 2 would be as great as it is, I'd have just saved my money for Gears 2.",4.0,B0014CFO4K,You'll Wish Epic Had Made It This Way The First Time,Video Games

"Legend of Dragoon  is one of those role playing games that definitely gets credit for a story and events straying from typical. These warriors obtain these gems that allow them to transform into armored warriors and slightly change the course of battle.

The game features some nice cutscenes, nice graphics, SOME interesting characters, and an interesting plot only brought down by some uninspired or drab locales, a somewhat predictable or cliched set of events, and a few annoying voice overs.

Graphics- 7/10

Prerendered backgrounds that are quite lovely. Beautiful and action packed FMV sequences that are definitely worth watching. Transformations that are eye catching. Some of the character models are a little blocky; however, they animate quite well in and out of battle. They animate with such fluidity fit the game quite well.

Sound- 7/10

The music wasn't exactly epic, but it worked. Some of the music was a little monotonous; but it was suiting.

Sound effects were quite pleasant. Earlier in the game, you could hear the rushing of the water. Every action had a suiting sound effect.

The voices were both good and bad. The voices of the characters fit them perfectly, but some of the voice acting didn't quite fit with some of the actions of some of the characters; they were good for the most part though.

Story- 8/10

The story was quite enjoyable and unique. The story didn't drag too much and kept its pace. The one thing I can say is that the story itself didn't deviate too much...or at least the events that occurred during the story. Everything just falls into place nicely. The fact that the game revolved around warriors able to harness the power of ""dragoon armor"" was pretty cool.

Gameplay- 7/10

The gameplay is typical RPG fare. It seems the two ways to determine gameplay lies within how exploration takes place and how battles are played. Exploration takes place as most of the RPGs do; the battle is turn-based. Fighters can time their attacks (using X) to do a combo attack that can take more damage than just initiating an attack.

You can also transform into dragoons during battle which actually add to the strategy of battles. There is a basic attack that requires you to time your button presses which (like the character chain/combo attacks) can deal more damage the more times you press the attack button at the right time.

I recommend this game to anyone who's looking to play an RPG that is a little different in terms of characters and abilities. The Sailor Moon-esque element this game has definitely makes it different from a lot of the other RPGs out there. It isn't quite the ""Final Fantasy VII"" that the back of the box (or perhaps reviews) made it sound to be, but it is quite good and worth the try.",4.0,B00004S9AF,Quite an Adventure...,Video Games

It's safe to say that although it's like others, as far as gameplay goes, I just can't forget the feeling I got when I first stepped onto the newly designed field at invesco mile high and my jaw dropped. It's still the best looking of the series and much cheaper than the finely tweaked/tuned 2010 version. This game is one of the best madden experiences out there. And it's much easier for beginners. With the replay feature and simplified play calling, this might be the most intuitive madden game to date. Even the virtual training sim is very helpful. I think the poor reviews are from those who've been madden heads for the last 20 years. And in that case, I'd say you're burnt out and there's nothing they could do to satisfy you.

"BioWare certainly did out-do themselves with this game.  I have been a BioWare fan since the original Baldur's Gate, and this game continues their reign as king of the computer role playing game genre.

One of the greatest elments of this game is the world BioWare created for it.  There are all sorts of monsters and dragons, but it is in the area of protagonists where the world, while resembling traditional fantasy RPG, is completely new.

There are dwarves, elves and humans, but their backstory is not like that of fantasy RPG games past.  In this world, dwarves are not drunken Scots, but scheming politicos isolated in a society controlled by an oppressive caste system.  Dwarves are more likely to stab you in the back than club you in the face in this game.

Elves are the underclass in this game.  Whatever they were in ancient times, today they are not the pompous immortals, but servants and whipping boys.  Being smallish, they are easily enthralled by the human populace who use them as house servants and employ them in menial and laborious tasks.  No longer educated and enlightened, they are easily taken advantage of.

The humans are not the same dundering sods who have screwed up the planet time and again, but the one element actually trying to hold it all together, despite the retreat of the dwarves into the underworld and the elves into servitude.  Not as devious as the dwarves, but humans are arguably more intelligent, and more physically capable than the elves; the humans dominate the world's surface.

One of the most interesting twists on the standard fantasy world fodder in the application of the mage class.  The mage is not the elder intellectual being spouting volumes of wisdom at every turn.  In this game mages are to be despised.  They are truly powerful beings, and not ""balanced"" as in some other games out there.  But their power has made them dangerous.  They have become channels for the demons who seek to destroy the world.  So the mages are essentially imprisoned by the church and kept under constant supervision by the Templars to ensure they do not turn.

Gone, too, is the multi-theism found in most fantasy worlds.  In this game there is only one god, and all sentient creatures follow it.

Mechanixcally, I found the game tobe of the highest caliber.  The animations and the visuals in general are extremely well done.  Considering that that game has been in development for some 4 years, that its graphics still hold up to the latest is a testament to the skills of the BioWare team.  Admittedly, the game is not as graphically stunning as, say, Fallout 3 or Oblivion, but the difference is neglible at worst.  And this game trumps either of those Bethesda titles in the vastness and intricacies of the story behind the gameplay.  In Oblivion and Fallut 3 you can wander to anywhere you can see on the screen, but the storyline is fairly sparse and the interconnectivity of the quest system is minor and very scripted.  In Dragon Age, gameplay is story-driven, and that story is incredibly well written and incredibly well voiced by the actors.

If you are a Role Playing Game aficionado, this game is a must-have for your PC game collection.  It has more than earned it's place next to such favorites as Baldur's Gate II, Diablo and the Elder Scrolls series.  Action gamers and FPS'ers may have a difficult time getting into this game because of the pace and the dialogue, but this game was obviously not written to be a hybrid.  It is unashamedly a masterful RPG.

"Shantae will probably be the last game released for the Game Boy Color, and what a game it is!  Shantae features colors, animation, and scrolling backgrounds that must push the aging GBC to it's absolute limits.  The game is  so advanced that it puts many GBA games to shame!  But it's not just the technology that makes Shantae so stunning.
The play is multi-layred with over 50 locations to explore, many secrets to be discovered, money to be collected for buying fighting gear, and 3 mini-games.  Shantae (a magical half-genie), can also learn dances that change her form.  My favorite is the monkey, which lets you jump higher and climb walls.  As you play, day turns to night and back again.  It's a neat effect pulled off brilliantly in the graphics, but what makes it truly great is that it's not just for show.  You actually need to expolre areas at night to gain certain power ups and even to gain access to a hidden level.  That level can only be found if you play Shantae on the GBA.  That's right, Way Foraward has included a hidden level for the GBA only!
I was also really impressed with the integration of the story.  This is not a game where you read the booklet to know what's going on and what your motivation for playing is.  As you play the game, scenes take place that will progress the story.  Explaining why things are happening, who people are and where you need to go.
The only complaint I have is that the world is so huge,  the levels so labyrinthine that I can't believe a map mode wasn't included.  So I get lost often, but my wondering has helped me find a few hidden secrets.  So it's it's ot all that bad.

"The third installement of the SOR series! This game is also one of the best walkthrough action beat-them-up style game ever made! You have 4 characters to choose from with one secret character as well. This game is a little different 2 than the previous 2 games since there are multiple hidden paths you can take, and depending upon how you select your path determines the outcome of the game itself, it was a smart addition and added some level of detail for the game. Anyways, the game play in this SOR game might be some of the best, the controls are really well laid out, and are responsive. Each character has their own combination of attacks and speical moves, and also each character has a variety of speical attacks that can be utilized with different weapons gathered through out the game. Another very different aspect of this SOR3 is the music, its very high tempo and has some rather odd time signatures, particularly on the song cycle, and fuze. Then there are tracks that sound like nothing but classic SOR music such as the song Moon, and Poets. The graphics are great, and are the best in the series, particularly when or if you get the 1 of the final levels, the ending shows off the power of the Genesis 16-bit console. Another thing I will say is that the diffuclty in this game is also pretty high, this has got 2 be also the hardest of the SOR games. Play this game on the HARD mode and you will see what I am talking about. Lenght wise, I think its perfect, some people might find it a little long, but I think its perfect in that regards.

"FIRST THE GOOD NEWS.

This game has fantastic graphics.  They are bright and colorful and just plain well done.  If you're like me and used to seeing Wii sports and the various Mario games, this is going to knock your socks off.

Skylanders is also complicated enough to keep kids entertained.  By which I mean if you have a child like mine -- he's currently 9 -- who has previously set to memory hundreds of Pokemon and Kirby facts, then Skylanders has powers and hats and soul gems and characters to learn about.

There's online play that coordinates with the game.  Like some stuffed animals and dolls, you can get character codes which unlock online play that features mini-games.

The game has only mild violence.  On par, I would say, with Mario jumping on the mushroom folk.

The game has clues, particularly on the beginning levels.  My son plays with our next door neighbor who is only 6 years old, and he does alright.

The Skylander toys are quite detailed and can be played with separately.

The toys can also be taken to someone else's house and used with a different portal AND they 'remember' their previous adventures.  There's also a feature to 'nickname' them.  My son named his Spiro, ""David, Jr.""

BAD NEWS
This bad news can also be good news.  The game is a money suck.  There are 32 characters that it is possible to collect, and kids are going to want them because they play differently, and certain types are the only ones that can cross certain barriers.  Money-wise, this isn't good.  BUT, if you have a child that enjoys this game, then you know what you and/or Great Aunt Ruth can get for the next birthday.

The other bit of bad news is that it's possible to race through Skylanders to the end.  When I asked my son how he did this, he answered that he did it by going back to the first level and then leveling up.  Which hasn't dampened his enthusiasm, by the way.  When I ask him about that, he said that he replays levels because 'battle mode' is fun, and because the treasures are very difficult to find.

"As I always state, I'm a HUGE fan of the final fantasy series and of square enix. Let me say that this isn't as good as others in the series but its still a fantastic game and it's certainly not a let down.

Let me say you should play this game for at least an hour before you say ""oh, this game is crap,"" it'll take about that long for story to really develop. Once your through the first hour the story will be just as great as any other final fantasy (which if your a fan you know that's great). The battle system is a tad different from other final fantasy games but it'll be just as fun. The graphics are a ton better than the original FF3.

Overall I highly recommend this game for any final fantasy fan. But if your playing the series for the first time, I would get a different final fantasy before you get this one.",5.0,B000GABOTU,a great final fantasy game...,Video Games
"This is such a good game! For those who don't know, Halo Wars is an RTS (Real-Time Strategy) game where you control multiple units from a third-person perspective. You can create bases, build units, move them, and fight with them! The controls are very easy to learn with the tutorials. I highly recommend playing both tutorials (Regular & Advanced) before you play campaign or skirmish. THIS IS A NO SPOILER REVIEW!!!

Campaign:

This is a very fun and enjoyable campaign! I haven't done the entire thing yet, but I am almost done. The story is great, and it is easy to know what your objective is. Aside from the requirements for the mission in general, there are fairly easy side objectives that can be completed in the mission. There are 15 missions in the campaign, each taking approximately 15-20 minutes each. I had trouble with 2 of the missions, but I looked up online a good strategy. There is a co-op mode for the campaign, which makes hard missions a lot easier (especially if that friend is very good at the game). So overall, the campaign is very fun.

Skirmish:

Skirmish is a mode where you can play different game modes with different leaders from the UNSC and the Covenant. You can do 1-1, 2-2, and 3-3 games. You can either play by yourself or with your friends against AI enemies. There are 3 UNSC leaders and 3 Covenant leaders, each having different abilities and unique units. With the UNSC, your leader is NOT a general unit. With the Covenant, you can fight with and control your leader. There are tons of maps to choose from! There are 2 DLC packs, but I don't think they're worth buying. They just add a few extra maps. So overall, the skirmish mode is very fun.

Multiplayer:

Multiplayer is also very fun. You can do the same modes as Skirmish, but just on Xbox LIVE.I generally like the 1-1 matches better because if you're doing 2-2 or 3-3, if one player drops out on your team, it greatly decreases your chance for success. There is a rank-up system in Multiplayer as well. The only problem is that only about 5,000 people play multiplayer, so it's really hard to find a match unless you have lots of friends. So I haven't played multiplayer as much.

Overall:

Halo Wars is a great RTS that is fun to play and easy to learn how to play. All of the modes are very fun, but I prefer Skirmish over any other. The price is very good on Amazon, and it is very fun to play with a friend. I would highly recommend this to any Halo fan or any RTS fan in general.",5.0,B0017HW5LM,Excellent Console RTS!,Video Games

"Growing up in the 90s, Sonic the Hedgehog was my game of choice. I loved Sonic, loved everything about the games, and played them non-stop. Having been a Sonic fan all my life, I've seen my fair share of games come and go, and recently (past 10 years recently) have been incredibly disappointed with what I've seen.

Sonic Adventure was, in my opinion, the last ""good"" sonic game. One that was genuinely fun to play. It was likely a lot of Sonic fans saw this as fun as it was the first true departure from the side-scrolling platformer and into the 3D world, but it worked, despite some camera-issues and glitches here and there. Simply, it was fun, and that's all you really want to expect out of a Sonic game.

And that's why I love Sonic Generations. Its simply fun. Its less gimmicky than some recent games, and takes you back to a time when Sonic games were all about straight-forward fun, with quirky, straight-forward and entertaining level design.

Like the older games, the levels in Sonic Generations DO get harder the further you progress. Not impossible, but just harder. Many of the recent Sonic games just haven't had that natural progression.

I'd highly recommend getting this if you have ever loved a Sonic game. Its fun, straight-forward, throws-back to the good-ol 90s Sonic games. The soundtrack is quite phenomenal as well, so look forward to that!",5.0,B004X56OU8,Sonic is back,Video Games

"Out of all of the Xbox Dance games that we own I love this one the best. The creativity in this game is taken to a whole new level. Not only do you get to mimic the moves to the avatar but your able to customize your avatar down to the clothing, facial structure, hair shape and color as well as eyes. Give your avatar a tattoo or eye glasses just select them its that easy.

There are 3 levels of play mode for beginner (this is where I still play), intermediate (for those than can learn the moves quicker), and expert (after you've mastered the moves).

Choosing from songs from today's hot artists and old school you'll certainly find songs you remember from back in the day and songs playing on the radio today that you know and love. Get ready to learn some cool club movies and impress your friends and you'll even learn the names in the Power skooling mode. Breaks down the dance moves for you so you can learn at your pace. Move on to Dance Marathon mode when your ready to ""pop it like its hot"" and dance your way to breakin up a sweat while learning and breaking out the moves that will sure to get your ready for bikini this summer.

"Off-brand memory cards don't completely suck, unlike off-brand controllers. In my experience, they usually have some annoying quirk, ranging from one card that required its own boot disc to the more normal quirk of having a higher rate of data decay than a name-brand memory card. If your data is important, I would put it on a Sony memory card. If you're broke and just need more temporary storage space, you can save a few bucks going off-brand. I have 3 PS2 memory cards, and one is off-brand...and has a corrupt file. I don't even remember what the file used to be, but I can't delete it, so that card is forever a little bit smaller than my other two. I also have a game that literally takes an entire memory card, and isn't worth keeping the save after you beat the game. When I play it, I temporarily move stuff from one of my name-brand cards to my off-brand card. If you need a memory card and can afford this one, get it. Even if you don't care about the quality of the card now, you might regret your decision in a few years.

"Let me start by saying that I am a huge fan of open world games. However, I just didn't find SR2 to be exciting at all. The wierdest part is that I didn't like GTAIV and I did like the action that started off in SR2. But then is dragged and it dragged hard.

Gameplay
Let me say that the game play is really fun. I did enjoy the fighting mechanics. They are easy and really fit on the PS3 pad. Shooting was a bit of a hit and miss but enjoyable as well. I only wish that they had a auto target system, but it still got the job done. Headshots were interesting to come by. The driving was really fun. It reminded me of GTA San Andreas. The cars are all great and the cop cars are really fast. It helps when you are on chases. Taking over helicopters reminded me a bit of the original Mercenaries. It is easy to do.

Story
This is where things got a little wierd for me. Now I know that most games don't always have you doing righteous things, but I really felt bad playing this game. We have all seen the bad guy that wants revenge thing before so this should be no surprise. But I was a little shocked when your partner guns down what appears to be some 60 year old judge. It just didn't feel right. Also, I didn't like the fact that you can't play the game straight. What I mean is that instead of the open design of GTA, where you could do only story missions or sidequests whenever you choose, this game forces you to do a whole bunch of side quests and mini games before it opens up the next story mission for you to go through. I found that to be extremely frustrating especially when you were getting into the main story and then you have your attention diverted to do sometimes pointless side quests. Being a cop with a film crew like COPS was interesting until your umptenth time of trying to get enough points to move the game forward.

Overall
I would say that there are some great online mechanics in the fact that you can actually take someone with you to help out missions during play. That was fun. But overall, the pacing is what killed me. Breaking up what was an interesting story from time to time just to do meaningless tasks in order to continue was really annoying. Especially when you get to the juicy parts of the game. But if you can stomach that, then there is a chance that you might enjoy the game. I would say that GTA might be a better fit.",3.0,B0016PZYLS,Not What I Expected,Video Games

"This is microsoft's first (and only?) party-game.  Through the round you play minigames for orbs.  At the end of the round is a fusion frenzy, where you bet or bank your orbs.  You then try to get as many orbs into a scoring zone as you can to get points.  Whoever has the most points at the end of the rounds (2, 4, or 6), wins the game.
Each level has its unique minigames.  At the military base you drive tanks, the waterfront level has bumper boats.  But many of the minigames are very similar.
The graphics are OK, although the camera angle zooms out so far it's often hard to make out what's going on.  The sound is OK as well, but you can play with music you've saved on your x-box, which is nice.

"Ok, I admit it, I am a huge nerd and a cheapo.  To save a few pennies, I did an analysis of the cost per Microsoft Point across each of the sell values, 400, 800, 1600, 2400 MS points etc, because I wanted to learn which Microsoft Points online code offered the best value or highest return on investment.

Through my analysis I learned that the pricing was not consistent between all the codes.  Some came out to be as high as .83 cents real money per MS Point and others .80, and it was not a linear progression based on volume in a single purchase, i.e. it is not cheaper to buy the 1600 over the 800 point code.  I finally determined that the 2400 point codes offered the best return on investment at .80 per MS Point.

However, this may not be true in every instance, because like currency in the real world, the pricing for MS Points fluctuates, so perform your own analysis at the time of each sale to save a couple of pennies and maximize your return on investment.",5.0,B000B9RI14,Be sure to perform a cost per unit between MS Point Code values before purchasing.,Video Games
"Every one knows that this is the game where all the production and development team deserves a big pat on their back.

In my review I will talk and focus on -ve reviews given to this game. After reading through all the -ve reviews, here as well as other websites, I have come to conclusion that the such reviewers are pretty amateurs or newbies in the video gaming world. The good thing in reviews is that thanks to release of this game on all platforms now PS fans are not trashing XBOX fans and vice versa and the whole focus is on the game it self instead of console wars. Although I would like to hear if GTAIV performed well on XBOX or PS or equal.

The game is very vast and caries the honor of being the pioneer in roam freely & do whatever virtual world concept, i.e. GTAIII. GTAIV does face a challenge that how much free roaming and  flexible this new world is. Definitely GTAIV has provided the best virtual world ever but it sometimes increases the anxiety or enthusiasm  for gamer to expect more than the game can offer. For instance a lot of time while playing I have wished that I could go into that building/shop and see whats inside or I could flirt with a hot girl on the street more. But keep in mind the developers are not God that they can provide 100% virtual world.

This game shows clearly that how fast and keen human being is in developing almost another virtual world within this real world. We have created simulations of almost every process involved around modern human being i.e. virtual Stock Exchange, virtual wheather forecast, Second Life etc.. pretty soon you will see a release of Grand Theft Auto where millions of gamers will be simultaneously playing in only one centrally hosted Liberty City just like second life.

"I've never played a SOCOM game before, so I can't compare it to earlier SOCOM games.

I also don't play online - my comments are just about the single player campaign, and more specifically, playing this game with the Move/Sharpshooter.

After being frustrated by several 'Sharpshooter compatible' games for PS3 that really seemed to treat the Move as an afterthought, I saw this game for cheap and decided to dust off my Sharpshooter and give it one last try.

I think the designers of this game did the best job of trying to make the Sharpshooter a success right 'out of the box'. I especially like the fact that at the default setting, the camera tracking approximates your movement - if you pan the Sharpshooter slowly, the camera moves slow too - not a perfect 1:1 match, but I couldn't get other games to do this no matter how much I fiddled with the optional settings. And speaking of optional settings, SOCOM4 offers a lot of tweakability for the Move, so I may experiment with those as well. There are also in game onscreen button prompts.

Bottom line, with just a little learning curve, SOCOM4 actually gets to be fun with the Sharpshooter pretty quick.

Anyway, I saw the Sharpshooter on clearance for well under $10 at a local big box store, and it's too bad - with more games like SOCOM4, the Move might have had a bigger following.",4.0,B002ELCV00,Worth getting if you have a Sharpshooter,Video Games

"This is the first must-have game for Nintendo's new handheld. With great implementation of the DS' unique features, fun-for-anyone gameplay, and quirky tone, this will please both the masses and the diehards.

The hook here, obviously, is the touch screen. Let me tell you, using a stylus is just as intuitive as using a button interface. Everything is incredibly responsive; I can't think of a single time when I had to tap or rub repeatedly to get the game to react.

There are a respectable number of characters in the game, each with his or her own control mechanic. To complete the game, you must finish a set of each character's ""microgames"" (think minigames, only they last around 5 seconds each). For example, there's a character for ""slicing"", one for ""scribbling"", and another for ""dragging"", among others. This variety keeps the game fresh, and always makes you excited to play as a new person.

The microgames themselves are extremely well-designed. Although you are thrown straight into them, with no explanation or instructions, it's a cinch to figure out your objective and complete it within the time limit. You'll find yourself doing things as diverse as scribbling ketchup onto hot dogs, chopping carrots, or scratching backs. Lots of the games are funny, too. I should also mention that each game has three levels of difficulty, which adds more variety.

Maybe what I like best about this game, beyond the great gameplay, is the extraordinary amount of content. Sure, the ""main"" game can be finished quickly, but there's a boatload of things to do after viewing the credits. By earning high scores, you can earn tons of extra prizes. These prizes are really great and unique; you can unlock everything from a playable piano to a two-player ping-pong game.

This game has convinced me that the DS has real potential. It's a joy to play, it'll keep you entertained for hours, and it's full of little surprises that'll make you smile.

Almost like Zelda ! ( not yet as good ) . I can say this the best rpg on the psp i have ever played ( sorry Kh: Birth by sllep ). The rpg elements in this game are lovely and fun. this is like a game made out all rpg player expectation. Ok.. i know I'm exaregating some things, but this game is truly beautiful... But to made this review more detailed , I divided the rating in various section:

The story: 9.5/10 , the story is very engaging , The dragon things and village all that stuff are very interesting... this is almost like a story from an Anime.

Sound: 8.0, the music is lovely, most of them are very familiar ( if you ever played zelda ) that is why is not completely original in that way ,but the music is still beautiful. the bad part there is no voice in character only text which is ok for me.

Graphics: 8.5, the ""graphics"" is not that good if you compared it to Ghost of sparta, but the art design is beautiful: the environments and... girls !

Gameplay: 9.3, the gameplay is fun, but a bit repetitive just like KH, sometimes i feel like im only pressing the X button to the extreme! but what diference this to Kh is that this game the dodgin is actually worthy ! the camera is better and the rpg elements are better ! Kh felt most like a hack and slash... this game also give you more exploring just like Zelda.. In fact this game almost like Zelda

Overall: 9.2 , this game is amazing , but i cant give higher score because there is also more thing to consider and this game some flaws but overall is beautiful , just make me feel like im playing Ocarina in a Psp, so just stop reading this and buy this game !

"I'm sure some will disagree, but this is a game that got absolutely everthing right, from sound, to graphics, to balance, to gameplay.  It has an X factor that is hard to come by.  It's by turns maddening, addicting, scary, thrilling, and deeply rewarding.

Doom was a jaw-dropper when I first saw it.  Doom was cool, no doubt, but there's something about this that's for some reason 10X cooler than Doom.  From the labyrinthine ""mines"" to the cool robots, to the lightning effects- the whole thing just straight up rocks- even in 2009!!!!  Do yourself a HUGE favor- go to GOG.com, pay 5.99, and get Descent 1 and 2- 60 levels of old school goodness- hey, if you don't like it, you're just out 5.99.  If you have ANY taste for old school three dee blast fests- get it get it get it!!!

"ESPN Track and Field (PS2) is based on the 1999 Olympic Games. I own it, I'm also an athlete, a 100m-200m sprinter.

Positives:

1) The game is good to play for a certain time.

2) They manage to have the events close to real and with actual athletes by name and county.

3) The intro to each, the idea or have the words relating to the event is real unique, a 5star for that job.

4) The movement of the athletes are really good. (close to the real thing)

5) The compitision can be real good at parts of the race.

6) Have tutorals to show you which bottons are used to play the event.

7) The replay is great.

Negatives:

1) Not very much events.

2) After a 1hour of play, the game get pretty boring.

3) Don't have that great of choices in athletes on it.

4) Should've had Heats and Finals for the events to show that you really worked to compete in the finals.

5) When you break the world record, they really don't make a big thing bout it on the game. A few cameras here and there but nothing dramatic.

Tips for improvements for any new ESPN Track & Field games:

1) Should have a atleast athletes to pick from under atleast 15 countries.

2) Enter more events such as: 100m, 200m, 400m, 800m, 1500m, 110m hurdles, discus, hammer, shot put, javelin, high jump, pole vault, long jump, triple jump, 4x100m relay, 4x400m relay.

3) Have the record holder be able to compete in thier event in which they hold the record.

4) Improve the realisumn in the game (simular to the 2004 Athens)

5) Show medalist collecting medal on the medal stand.

6) Need a mixture of different country's music and not rock & roll for everything. Not everyone is a fan of rock & roll.

7) Give you the chance to create players and be able to train them (weight lifting, spint drills, sprint starts, endurance, jumps, etc.)for thier events so they can become stronger and also faster.

It's an okay game when you have extra time on your hands.",4.0,B00004U627,ESPN T&F Game,Video Games
"I was quite shocked on how well the game came out. The game was originally for the Nintendo 3DS and it was quite good. The campaign is fairly long. Raid mode will add more replay value to the game once you beat the campaign. With a new mode (Infernal mode)add to the mix, I don't see why anyone will pass this up. Capcom updated the graphics and added a new creature in the game. Here's my brutal honest about the game.

The good things

- Capcom updated the atmosphere giving it an HD look to it. When your on the ship, the camera sways giving it the feel that your actually on the ship.

- The music is fantastic.

- Tight corridors are back! I had numerous experiences where i ran out of ammo and i walk backwards to a corner.

- Jill's campaign is survival horror while Chris's is more action horror.

- You can now evade (similar to RE3).

- Hold up to three weapons and store weapons you picked up in an item box (Oh yeah. They make a return).

- Upgrading weapons in campaign and raid mode is actually pretty neat.

- Raid mode is addicting (yes. Raid mode is also 2-player online. Not local).

- Controls are easy to get use to.

- Can aim and shoot. Even reload while moving.

The bad things

- Keith and Quint are by far the most annoying characters i've ever played.

- Annoying that your partner is with you somewhat of the game.

For this one, i'll let you decide whether this is a pro or a con

- In the old games, backtracking was quite common. In Revelations, it makes a return. There will be times where you have/choose to backtrack. Whether it's to advance the story or open the door that you have been waiting to open. Honestly, this is more of a pro in my opinion but others find this a con.

Overall, this game is extremely fun. I beat the campaign last night and i was pleased on how well capcom ported this game. With Infernal mode and raid mode in the game, i can see myself playing this game fairly long time. You won't be disappointed!",5.0,B00B59L9VO,Resident Evil Revelations,Video Games
"Is Fallout 4 a perfect game?  Absolutely not.  Is it fun?  Definitely.

Things I like:
+The character customization is easy to use and ensures you can't make a truly disgusting character.
+The voice overs are extremely well done.  I like not reading the dialogue (note: you can turn on subtitles still) and just skipping ahead; the main character is well done and so are most of the supporting characters.
+Looking into containers can be done in real time.  You can still enter the container to loot all, but everything can be taken without going into another menu.
+Weapons and armor can be modified.  Most modifications will change the appearance.  The modifications have significant impact.
+During conversations, you can move around.  By interacting again, you'll go back into the cinematic mode.
+Power armor.  You feel POWERFUL in that piece of equipment.  They don't restrict it to ""heavy"" armor experts anymore ensuring everyone can use it.  It's more like a vehicle than an armor.
+Building settlements is fun.  I've spent way too much time already.
+Legendary enemies.  They keep you on your toes and will offer some fantastic rewards.
+Radiation Storms.  Foggy, green, and lightning.
+Perk system.  It replaces the old skill system and allows for a wide range of customization and play styles.  While not as clean as Skyrim's to navigate, I love the update here.

Things I don't like:
-No ultrawide monitor settings.  Consider games like Wasteland 2 have it, this is unacceptable.
-Stiff facial animations, wooden character movement.  The lips will move but the face remains stiff, creating awkward looking dialogue cinematics.
-Dated graphics.  Some of the textures are amazing.  I've ran into some really low resolution (some look straight out of Xbox/Playstation 2 generation).  I've also run into an LOD (level of detail) distance rendering bug at some quarry - the textures didn't switch over and it looked like Minecraft... it also created a veneer over the actual terrain causing me to fall through the textures and have difficulty navigating.
-Console controls.  While I don't personally have any trouble with the controls, it's very clear that the PC version was created with consoles in mind first.  The two worst culprits are keybindings not working an having to use the arrow keys IN ADDITION to WASD.  (The controls seem to work well on consoles).
-Companions are very powerful, even on the harder settings.  I play on the harder settings and I can sit back and let my companions take over 90% of fights.  The only times I need to help is if there is a legendary or particularly strong enemy.
-The difficulty of combat situations span a huge gulf.  It can go from a pathetically easy encounter to nearly impossible one minutes later.
-Bugs, bugs, bugs.  I had high hopes that after 6 years they would have ironed out more of the basic, common bugs.  Unfortunately I was wrong.

Neutral/No Opinion:
*Has many Skyrim like features including harvesting, interactive loads screens.
*Looks exactly like previous Fallout games.  Some minor differences, but you've seen this wasteland before.

It's easy to get caught up in wandering and exploring.  I find myself enjoying the discoveries and finding new weapons, armor, and items.  Settlements are a fun addition, though I hope there is more to them later.  This is definitely not a game of the year contender by any means.  However, it's still a ton of fun and if you're a Fallout fan, you'll enjoy going back into the wasteland.

I've seen super positive and super negative reviews.  This is not a 5/5 or a 9/10 out of 10 that I've seen professionals give.  It's also not a 1/5 or 4.7 on Metacritic.  This is most assuredly a 4 out of 5.

Edit: Folks that are looking at reviews, understand there is a trend right now of PC players being extremely negative towards this game.  My review upsets them because I actually enjoy the game.  Great game using a flawed engine where most of the issues tend to stem from.

If you purchase this on Steam, remember you can get a refund if you don't like it within 2 weeks or less than two hours played (whichever comes first).

You can get some insanely cool powers that make you feel unstoppable, but there's also multiple difficulty levels for those who want a real challenge. There are alternate endings for each character depending how you play. Bethesda said they will be patching in another difficulty level and a New Game + mode for free which will kick up the replay value even more. I have not encountered any glitches or bugs yet.

"This mouse is small and lightweight with quick buttons and fast performance.  Combined with some decent software, this mouse certainly seems to meet its expectations as a pure MOBA mouse.  As a general purpose mouse, it falls short, but it doesn't seem fair to judge it as such given that it's marketed as a MOBA mouse.  It also complements other Logitech gaming peripherals such as the keyboard.

This mouse is held not with a palm on top but gripped between the thumb and pinky.  Its lightweight makes it easily maneuvered, and the software allows for quick switches between DPI settings via toggle or modifier keypresses.  By that I mean you can swap DPI settings by depressing a button or you can quickly switch to a certain DPI simply by holding a key such that releasing the key would return it back to the previous DPI (much like the shift key is used to modify lower case).

The optical sensor on this mouse seems designed for performance rather than versatility.  So while it is extremely fast, it won't work on certain materials like clear glass.

It should also be noted that this mouse pales in comparison to most of Logitech's other gaming offerrings with regard to productivity.  It is not an ideal general purpose mouse.  It is meant to be quick and nimble and provide some level of customizability through the gaming software.  Its ideal use is precision clickery for strategy games, and for that I give it 5 stars.  Otherwise, I wouldn't recommend it.",5.0,B00OHJY7C2,Quick and nimble; Great for precision click games.  Not an ideal productivity mouse.,Video Games
"I never thought that this game would ever be released outside of Japan, even after it was announced for U.S. release I still couldn't believe it. There are some awesome detailed reviews here already so I'll spare you the specs and just touch on the key points. If you enjoyed Marvel Vs. Capcom 1/2, Capcom Vs. SNK 1/2 then stop reading and buy this if you haven't yet. If you don't have a Wii, buy a Wii and buy this game. You probably won't recognize many/any of the Tatsunoko characters but that really doesn't matter. Those of you that grew up in the 80's might remember the characters from Gatchaman (G-Force in the states), anime freaks will recognize Karas but that's about it. The rest of the lineup haven't had much exposure over here if any...but they are all spectacular characters for the Vs. series. I love the graphics, the cell-shaded 3D is a perfect fit, makes me hopeful for MvC3 using a similar style (it could happen!). There is a ton of unlockable content, the shop system is pretty much like MvC2 was on the Dreamcast, single player is just as solid as multiplayer thanks to that. The gameplay is basically a simplified MvC2, don't worry though, plenty of depth for the hardcore. This is a 2 on 2 set up and you can freely swap your characters out to regain health, just like MvC. You have 3 attack buttons, light/medium/heavy, and a Partner/Assist button to call in your other character. I honestly don't think the strategy or depth is negatively impacted by a 4 button setup at all, once you play for a few hours you'll start to see how complex 4 buttons can be. I've played MvC2 for nearly 10 years, I have a PS3 and I love Street Fighter IV and BlazBlue but I can say without a doubt that this is the most fun I have had with a fighting game since playing Street Fighter 2 in the arcades all those years ago, only time will tell if it will stay fun for as long.

"This controller is very good, to the point of almost feeling like a dualshock 3. It connects flawlessly and despite having an off switch it will go into a standby mode if left on without button presses for a few minutes. My only problem is that the analog sticks are stiff and thus the sensitivity is bad. That is, there is very little registration of a half push so, for instance, walking slowly in Metal Gear Solid 2 is a chore to do. Push slightly too far and it's an instant run, but not far enough amd you don't move. It's like there's a blind spot in the center. This also affects aiming, but this issue isn't a deal breaker. What might be a dealbreaker is that the pressure sensitivity of the face buttons is either just as difficult or nonexistent.

Both of these problems combined, this is still an amazing controller and most of the time you won't notice its faults. It's well built so it doesn't feel cheap in your hands and it's nearly identical to the dualshick 2 in terms of weight and feel while also being wireless. I don't know how long batteries last but I'm going to wager that they don't use a lot of power. I've played with it for about 30 hours and it hasn't stuttered on the connection (which would be the first sign of a low battery).

"Let's get this out of the way: if you own a PS3, then you must play this game.

I've had a lot of fun playing inFamous. Sucker Punch got of lot of things right with the game, but some minor flaws keep the game from being perfect.

First, the good stuff. Love the open playground that is Empire City's three areas: the Neon District, the Warren, and the Historic District. Climbing buildings, riding the rails (literally), jumping off rooftops, etc. Cole's powers are great; I especially enjoy using Thunderdrop when jumping off a rooftop. The story missions are interesting, giving you a little bit of everything from search and destroy, escort missions, to one where you have to get rid of giant poison ballons, just like in Tim Burton's Batman movie, with the exception of not having the batwing. The side missions tend to get repetitive, but not to the point where you don't want to do them. The graphics, music, and sounds are excellent, with things like the jingling of Cole's backpack and the cries of the bystanders adding little touches to the game. The storyline is good, with some predictable twists. The Karma choices, which will determine your path, don't affect the overall storyline, but will affect the environment, your character's look, as well as how the public's reaction to you.

As for the flaws of the game: even though the platforming is fun, and at times vertigo inducing, its sometimes frustrating when you want Cole to jump or fall in one place and the game will just push him somewhere else. You will also occasionally see enemies or bystanders stuck in a falling animation, or Cole himself will get stuck when climbing a rail or a rooftop. The game is also a bit easy. I only died a few times, even on Hard mode, and the game only has 3 major boss fights.

But again, the flaws are things that will not get in the way of enjoying this game. So pop in the disc and start playing. The people of Empire City need a Hero... but that doesn't mean it has to be you.",5.0,B000ZK7ZOE,What path will you choose?,Video Games

"When Oblivion first came out for the 360 i put 80 hours into, finished all of the guilds and most of the side quest, after over saturating myself i took 8 months-1 year break, and decided recently it was time to get back into it and I have beat Knights of Nine(which is also on this very same disc) and am half way through Shivering Isles.  And here we are...

Knights of Nine

-Good-

~Lengthy quest (5 hours), fun beginning, cool ending.  You get a new outfit with fairly nice benefits, nothing jaw dropping though.

~Kind of boss fight at the end in a cool environment(i don't want to spoil it)

-Bad-

~Half of the quest deals with you traveling all over the map to touch shrines(to become blessed), you have to find 8-9 of them.  You get a map, but the actual locations aren't marked on your main map so sometimes it takes longer then it should to find one.  Became some what tedious.

~More fetching type activites then actually meeting interesting characters, go in this cave to find this, go to this other cave to find that, etc...

~Everying thing besides the new boss where you fight the boss, and armor, you've seen before.

Shivering Isles

-Good-

~Very interesting story, great ideas and concepts.
~New environment, new weapons, new armor, new tougher enemies, great dialogue.
~Great main quest, and some entertaining side quests ( the first side quest i did; i was told by a distraught civilian that he hated his life and wanted me to kill him, but he didn't want to see it coming)
~You come across some interesting characters as mentioned above.
~Lengthy, i've put 15 hours into so far and am probably only half way done.
~Decent price, you get what you pay for, after all, $30 isn't cheap for an add-on.

-Bad-

~Review after review stats how different the two worlds are, mania(happy/energetic) and dementia(sad/angry), but honestly, they're not that different.  Don't get me wrong, you can tell which is which, but it's not nearly as extreme as i was made to believe.  Let's take leaves off trees and paint the vegetation in darker shades and call it dementia.  So far that's my only complaint.

For $30 this is a good deal because you actually get what you pay for.  An additional 30-40hours to an already extremly lengthy and well made game.  One side note, i bought this game downloaded it onto my 360, brought it my friends place and downloaded on his as well(he also had Oblivion).  Therefore, if you know someone else who wants it you guys should split the cost because you just download it on your hard drive and don't actually need the disc to play the game(you only need the Oblivion disc).",4.0,B000VXKSLW,"Shivering Isles and Knights of Nine, good add ons to a great game",Video Games
"I purchased the original Ninja Gaiden 3 at $20 & it was ok.
not as bad as they said BUT it was nowhere as good as Ninja Gaiden 1 or 2.

I really just bought this for the new characters & weapons & especially for the GORE/DISMEMBERMENT.
& I like that all the weapons are now available instead of as DLC $$$$.
also the other modes are there too for online etc.

the unlockables costumes, most of them were in previous games. i wish they had all new costumes.
that was a bit of a letdown. i think there are only 2 new costumes.
(if you have a save from the regular NG3 it gives you a cool costume too)

I do like the villain in this game. He has a very cool theme song.
music is good & there are some excellent tracks.
The AI in this game is still cheap. but not as grabby as the regular Ninja Gaiden 3.
the control does show some lag.
they never FIXED that awful T-rex boss.

I beat part 1 & 2 with all the weapons & many many times. I just don't see myself doing that with this game.
it lacks the soul of Ninja Gaiden

still it's a VERY GOOD game if you like action, you will like this a lot.
and it has a lot of content replay value compared to the original NG3 that was released.",3.0,B00BFU8IBC,at least it's better than the normal Ninja Gaiden 3,Video Games

"I'm 14 years old and I've played Capcom's Resident Evil 5, but have not played the previous Resident Evil titles. I hope you find this review to be helpful.

  Resident Evil: Action, Zombies, Intense Gore, Two-players Optional.

  Resident Evil 5 features a zombie epidemic.

  This review contains no spoilers.

  While I have not played the earlier Resident Evil titles, Res-Evil 5 does a good job on keeping you up to date if you haven't played them either. As stated above, Resident Evil features a zombie epidemic. With you as the hero, Chris Redfield (I call him Steroid-Man) and his partner Sheva, you work as an agent for the BSAA, (I forget what it stands for) an orginazation trying to maintain the balance of biotic weapons.

  Pros:

  Realistic Graphics - Res-Evil 5 combines realistic graphics and cutscene-looking movements of characters, making it look as if you're in a movie.

  Varying Enemies - You don't just fight mindless zombies the whole time (I should add that they have decent health, unlike some other zombie-titles), you also fight enemies like flying octopus-bat things and dogs that split their heads open to clamp it down on you. Not to mention all the unique bosses.

  Varying Bosses - Without giving anything away, I can promise that if you like Res-Evil 5, you'll love its bosses. Most of them are the size of buildings, taking heavy weapons to bring down.

  Currency - I'm sure there are players who don't like using money earned in the game on weapons to use in-game, but I thought it was a cool feature. Selling treasures that you find in the story mode (such as gold beetles, pricless jewelry etc.) gives you - that's right - money to buy weapons such as proximity mines, stun-rods, even grenade launchers.

  Keeping you Up-to-Date - Like me, if you haven't played the recent Res-Evil games, this game is pretty good at keeping you on track. Of course you would be better off playing the recent ones, but things such as flashbacks and game history on loading screens won't leave you too confused on the story.

  Multiplayer - If you get bored or stuck in the game, you can have two-player mode (not online, I might add) where you and your friend work together to overcome the bosses and zombie hordes. You can also go online and jump into someone else's game at any time (to prevent someone from joining yours, you can switch on ""Private"" Feature).

  Cons:

  Maturity Rating - As you have probably noticed this game has earned itself an M for mature. This is solely because of the gore and some swearing. There are some skimpy-clothed females in the game, but never anything too notable. It's all the gore, heads exploding etc.

  Frustrating Moments - I have encountered several instances in the game where an area is extremely hard. It might me the medium difficulty setting, but there are some bosses who will cause furstration.

  Unique Style of Gore - Resident Evil 5 not only has limbs blowing up all the time, but it also has some newer (and frankly more gorey than blood) versions of gore. It has - excuse the depth of description - heads exploding and being replaced by dripping tentacles, or zombies having messy worms coming out of the mouths to infect their victims. I've played a ton of gore games, but Res-Evil 5 is unique in that way.

  Overall I'd rate this game 3.75 stars, (but Amazon doesn't allow decimals), mainly because of (one-person's opinion) I prefer open-world and leveling games. Resident Evil 5 still makes a fun game throughout the journey, but after awhile going online and re-running the story can get kind of old.

"I'm not typically one to bash video games. Brink had some interesting commercials so I decided to take the plung. This is one of those games where I found myself feeling suckered.

Let's start with the single player/offline mode. I was excited for the character customization. The graphics were alright; nothing stellar but I'm not that interesting in graphics anyway. Once the game started, the problems began rolling in like a tsunami. The enemies are strangely persistent, the weapons are rather lame, the upgrades aren't all that exciting, and the game just feels like it's missing something. The maps are small, the missions are essentially go here, go there, kill x. When you're playing alone, you have to rely on some incredibly stupid AI bots. Whatever though. Nobody really expects shooters to have a good storyline or offline mode.

The online multiplayer aspect of this game is what absolutely kills this game. The combat is just clunky, the controls are terrible (though you can change the settings), and the classes are messed up. I have a decent wired internet connection (12mbps) and I found this game to be laggy as all hell. Even with the patch, this game is borderline unplayable online sometimes.

When I popped this game out of the 360, I was especially shocked to see that BETHESDA made this game. The people who brought us Oblivion and Fallout 3. I don't know what's going on at that company, but they've been turning out bad games left and right these days (New Vegas is the only other game I've rated poorly).

Bottom-line:  Just skip this game. You'll be saving your money and time.",1.0,B002DC8GKE,This is a game to skip.,Video Games

With this one I have found at times I need to speak loudly for it to pick up my voice rather than talking in my normal tone which can get a little annoying, however the older version of the wireless mic never had this problem for me so I'm not sure how this went downhill. I don't use this as a blue tooth device so I can't have an opinion on that. Other than having to speak a little louder than normal when I play there isn't anything wrong with it.

"Positive:
+ Guitar Hero = FUN
+ Aerosmith guitar style fits the gameplay well
+ perfect for fans of the band

Negative:
- it's exactly the same as GHIII
- really short and not too challenging

Guitar Hero is a franchise that has established itself in the gaming world with some of the most fun and addicting gameplay out there. With the first band-centered game in the series, GH: Aerosmith does a great job of delivering to fans of the band, but for the rest of us it's just more songs to play.

There are several reasons the game is best for fans of Aerosmith. The first reason is that the game's story is totally centered on the band (obviously) and there is band commentary between each of the game's six sets. They talk about their career and the high points highlighted in the game. There are also little fun facts about the band on the loading screens sometimes. One of the other cool things about the game is how the motion capture was done with the band, putting their own stage presence in every performance.

And then there's the game's setlist. While being very short (as in only 30 or so songs plus roughly 10 vault songs) it's very fun. It is, after all, Guitar Hero. Guitar Hero is always fun! The gameplay is exactly the same as it was a year ago in Legends of Rock, nothing at all has been added. In fact, everything else is either exactly the same or close to it; the menus are just themed differently, and the multiplayer and online is exactly the same.

So we have established that the game is perfect for Aerosmith fans, right? So what exactly does it offer for those of us who haven't followed or even listened to the band? Well, we get more of the same fun gameplay like I said before. We also get some new songs, many of which are really fun. Most of the songs in the setlist aren't very hard to beat, but there are a few tough ones such as `Crazy Train.'

Aerosmith's guitar style is really quite good for the game. There are a lot of parts with chords, a lot of cool hammer-on sections, and some awesome solos that are very satisfying to nail down to the last note. So while the setlist isn't very long at all and offers little challenge (I beat the career within less than 24 hours of getting the game... on Expert), it is very fun.

The game's sound quality is pretty good. The quality of the songs is great, but the volume equalization is pretty bad. The game will be way too loud on the menu and then pretty quiet during actual gameplay, which is strange and annoying. Of course the guitar squeaks are still pretty annoying, and the crowd actually claps off beat to the song when you activate star power. Other than those few problems the sound quality is good.

The graphics, on the other hand, are either equal to Legends of Rock or possibly a tad worse.  The Wii version of the game, at least, has visuals that could have been improved. Two of the big areas they could have improved on are those of hair movement and guitar playing. Some of the lighting effects are good, though. Overall the graphics could have (and should have) been better, the Wii is capable of more than this.

So to sum it all up, Guitar Hero: Aerosmith is a good game. While it mainly caters to fans of the band it is all about, it's still an enjoyable, albeit short, experience for those of us who just like Guitar Hero. It's definitely worth a rent for fans of the franchise, worth a buy for fans of the band, and almost worth fainting over for any combination of the two.

"I own a PS3 and salivated over this game since it came out for the xbox and was deprived. But I had a secret weapon. A decent PC gaming machine and patience. It finally came out for PC and despite the awful reviews and horror stories, I just had to risk it.

Okay, this game got butchered for the DRM and the crashes. I agree with everyone as I suffered through an install meltdown. I installed the game, I tried to play it and the dreaded red x box came up stating some wierd technical reason. My heart sunk and I felt like I just bought a 50 dollar coaster. I decided to go to their website for some help. Don't do it! The website was not helpful in the least. So frustrated, I called technical support. Surprisingly, he was extremely helpful despite the thick indian accent. He moved me step through step every click of the way and solved the problem! Throughout technical support was great, but it should have never gotten to that point in the first place. So I agree with everyone on that point. DRM punishes honest customers. It's total (explative).  By no means do I plan on playing this game on more than one computer so why put a limit. This is a pure one person game, it's not an MMO so what's with the paranoia? Why limit it to 3? Worse is you need to be online to authenticate the game not once but forever! Once again, this is not an MMO so now you are punishing people who do not have internet access in their homes. Not cool. If this was any other game, I gaurantee I would not buy it. It is only because I don't have any other means of playing it.

Okay, now to the game. Does anyone remember Starflight for the Sega Genesis back in the day? Yeah I'm showing my age. Anyway this is Starflight the next generation! I always hoped for a sequel for the PC or next gen consoles. Alas it never happened but Mass Effect is the same exact thing! From the the free form explaration map, to your alien crew, to even the Mako! Except for the true imersion from exploring your own ship to exploring other worlds on foot, to traveling in the mako. On and on and on. The graphics are beyond amazing in my opinion especially during dialog sessions. The faces are amazing looking. The voice acting is top notch, the music is amazing too. I kind of want the soundtrack of this. The story line is great with plenty of side missions to keep you very busy and a neat little romantic subplot which adds to the space opera feel. This led to some paranoid attacks from fox news and middle aged men and women who not only never played this game but never played video games in their lives. When the so called ""sex"" scene came to fruition. I laughed. This stuff is so mild compared to MTV which ""your kids"" watch every single day. Tila Tequila is hardcore porn compared to this.

Now for the bad. The combat system truly sucks. You cannot control the AI characters period. I just let them go and do their thing and pretty much fight on my own. The shooting and targets are not crisp and definite like 1st person shooters which is what this combat is trying to be. The inventory system takes a long time to get used to and is not efficient. It's so unpractical that you end up amassing equipment just because you don't want to go into the inventory system. The game certainly lags and I have a decent rig which I will list at the end of this review. I have never had a crash but at times it seems like it will freeze for a few seconds when I move to the main menu and makes me think it is ready to crash but eventually goes to the menu. Dialoge sometimes skips but not often. These gripes are trumped by the fun factor. The fact is the game played through without crashing once and even though your have combat a lot, your interest lies more in the story and advancing the story.

If you have an x box 360 get it for that, but if you don't have one it just might be worth the risk, but make darn sure you have the right pc specs!

"I, like many other people, absolutely loved Far Cry 3.  It was a breath of fresh air in a sea of boring shooters.  I've probably played through that entire game 4 or 5 times (on both PS3 and PC).  Naturally, my expectations for FC4 was pretty lofty and for the most part, they've been met.

First things first - it's a gorgeous game, even on medium settings.  I was able to capture a few screen shots on ""ultra"" and if your rig can run it, you're in for a treat.  It's simply beautiful.  Character models and environments are superb.  I'm sure the same holds true for PS4 and XBox1 versions.  It's the cream of the crop.

Secondly, this is a VERY familiar game.  All the mechanics, as far as I can tell, are exactly the same, as are the skill trees.  There are two trees (Tiger and Elephant), but a quick glance through them reveals they're pretty much the same.  Other similarities: the guns are identical and you still get a lot of the same side quests.  You'll get to liberate bell towers instead of radio towers.  Among the new additions: using bait to lure animals and throwing knives (don't require a takedown like in FC3), the gyrocopter and the surprising inclusion of choice in missions.  You'll occasionally have to choose between missions (the other mission will cancel out).  I'm also glad the hang gliders are still around as that's my favorite, leisurely mode of travel.

As for the story, well, it's just OK.  After a brilliant and original set up, including an opening scene that's just wonderful (thanks to Troy Baker's Pagan Min), the story is just kind of so-so, largely because the Ajay, the protagonist, is about as exciting as Jason Brody from FC3.  It seems that with Far Cry games, the villains get the best dialogue and are far more interesting characters.  Troy Baker is fantastic, as he usually is (he's on quite a run playing the lead characters in The Last of Us, Infamous Second Son, COD: Advanced Warfare, Bioshock Infinite, etc).  His Pagan Min is truly unhinged, yet utterly magnetic thanks to Baker's performance.

Now to the technical bits. If you want the full experience, you're going to need a hefty rig.  I've had to content myself with my graphics set to medium.  My buddy, who also has the game (we were conversing over the phone while playing at the same time), has two video cards and he can't run the game on ""ultra"" settings.  The game also crashed after 15 minutes of the opening cut scenes and I had to watch those 15 minutes of cut scenes a second time.  When I tried to set my graphics to ""NVidia"" settings, I got a 15 minute freeze in which I couldn't do anything.  Very frustrating.  Ubisoft has said there will be a day one patch, so hopefully that will rectify some of the issues.  By the way, it's a 21 gig download and then another 30-40 minutes to ""unpack"" it.

In short, if you enjoyed FC3, you'll enjoy FC4.  Just don't expect any huge leaps forward.  What you get is a big beautiful sandbox with lots to do, fantastic gunplay and sneaking bits, and a terrific villain every bit as entertaining as Michael Mando's Vaas from FC3.

I don't know that it's absolute must buy (especially on PC in which it be under $10 in six-nine months) at this point.  I'd say definitely wait for a price drop, but it's a game definitely worth playing.",4.0,B00KAED6Y8,welcome to the....mountains.,Video Games
"Listen kids, corporate America exists to make money...not to please your degenerate gaming needs.  Waiting 12 years for a game doesn't mean it's going to be 12 years worth of great development.  Yes, it's unfortunate that it took 12 years for this game to release but creating a bad review simply because your expectations were off the chart, isn't needed.  You want to berate the developers and executives, then fine; but have some objective analysis on the game at least.

From a very casual gamer's standpoint, the game is fun.  Most enjoyable about it is that it doesn't take itself seriously.  Most of the content is absurd and crude but that's the appeal of the game.  Cut away scenes are comical and entertaining.

Unfortunately, graphics aren't the best and a lot of times I found myself lost, not understanding what I was suppose to do next.  I will also agree with most who said a lot of the game play is somewhat redundant and mundane.  Just give me some unimaginable weapon and let me unload on 35 aliens, I have no desire to jump on a shrink pod and navigate a Duke Burger kitchen in order to save some Duke Burger employee from electrocution.  I've never used Google so much on a game to find out how to solve dead end problems.  The ending was also terrible...I'm not sure it even made sense to me.

Now u have most likely see some of the s*** the ""game press"" is talking about the X1 will they should just work for FOX News or the PS magazine they want Sony to winning because they scared of MS winning again  .

 So all talk to the hardcore gamers first I've been a core game most of my life and the X1 is a dream come true and here way the X1 has better games it gets all the big game + titanfall and no matter what you might have heard EA and respawn has reapply said its not coming to PS4 Sony is just hoping the rumors will hurt X1 hardware sales off of titanfall and X1 also has Halo 5 and Halo 2 anniversary, gears of war, KI is great, a partnership with EA, DR3, the best racing games, and Xbox live you can't be a core MP gamer with out X live its light year better then PSN + MS has never lost cord numbers so its more safe for your $ and the X1 OS is fast and  mind blowing 5 app and one game can be running at the same time and you can switch instantly between them, with your X1 controller or much faster and cool with Kinect now that not because the controller is slow its because you can said what you want and it instantly go to it the first time 95% of the time and MS will release updates,  so I can be play BF4 or TB and with 2 words be watching Dexter on Netflix and instantly switch back to TB and it'll  just be paused waiting for you and then you can go back to Netflix with one word and it will continue what you were watching instantly or you can use the guide button and just going to the Netflix app and you'll get the same thing has use Kinect just not has fast . And about the Kinect, will I didn't like the idea to start with but now I love it make everything so quick and it has been really cool in game like in TB you can just say what gun you want and it will switch instantly so I can be using my bow at long range and say shotgun to soot the guy who coming up on were I'm aiming at him and it will switch so I don't have to stop aiming, and of this cool Tony Stark and star trek s*** does not interest you can't always turn the Kinect off or just unplug it from your X1 and run it over with your car and you can still do everything with your X1 you could do with your X1 with the Kinect plugged in. The Xbox one is just getting start of you don't get one you'll be sorry latter way pay 400$ now just so you can pay 500$ in a year or so or let Sony loose your cord numbers or get a f up console the PS4 is the most over rated console I ever play its doesn't do anything new or interest I can't believe how many people are acting like its better then X1  so I fill very strongly about this because I feel like people or being lied to so they don't even give the X1 a chance and don't know that they're missing something special .

And for the casual gamer I on the 100$ less is tempting but you are really loosing at lest 150$ in value . The X1 is great for everyone with its movie a TV apps it will take over your living room and everyone in your household will want to use it your teenagers son or will love all the games your wife will love the Kinect and its game like zoo tycoon and everyone will love the TV and Movie apps and the Kinect is great of you are cooking or working .

And if you're the kind of parson who love game but only has like a hour a week the X1 is sweet because it will always keep your place and restart instantly so when you have to leave you can just say Xbox off and it will not loose your place and its with restart in like 10 sec when you get home I love the X1 and I think you will too I hope you will give it a try",5.0,B00CMQTVUA,so i love the X1 this is way,Video Games

CD Projekt Red has become one of the best developers in the gaming industry. They released free DLC that other companies (EA) would have charged for. Now they have released two paid expansions Hearts of Stone and Blood and Wine. You can buy both at 25 dollars, which is fantastic considering that companies charge nearly full price for DLC.

In the first DLC Hearts of Stone you rejoin Geralt the white wolf, as he must grant three wishes to a man named Olgierd Von Everec an enigmatic man with an even more enigmatic adversary Gaunter ODimm. Olgierlds requests have Geralt attending a wedding, planning a heist, and exploring a haunted house. Hearts of Stone is simply one of the best-written quests ever as it puts focus on the antagonist. Something the main game ignored as a result we have a better villain than the main story. The DLC brings old flame Shani from the first game and she is truly a great character a far cry from Yennefer and Triss. The DLC is about 10 hours long and is definitely worth it even if you don't buy the Expansion Pass, Hearts of Stone will cost ten dollars.

Blood and Wine is not out yet so I will update the review when it does.

The Expansion Pass is worth a buy it is a steal and CD projekt has proven you don't need to nickel & dime consumers to get their money. A must for any fan of the Witcher 3.",5.0,B00WRJCRP8,The White Wolf is Back!,Video Games

"Greatest TRUE horror game since Silent Hill. And YES (although silent hill was a masterpiece) this is BETTER. This game completes me! I just want to thank the makers of the game for investing the time and quality into making a true HORROR game and not a game based on zombies or vampires or just a shoot em up press square.
It is so rare we get a horror game based on story and suspense and adds elements of true fear without depending on just the most overdrawn theme of zombies.
This game relies on atmosphere and eery sounds and visuals of someone looking for you while you fight and try to escape while figuring things out in this adventure. The graphics make the game feel real, the storyline is impeccable, the depth to detail in figuring out your surroundings while interacting with other players is beyond captivating. I feel bad I have to wait once every 5 to six years before a real horror game comes out. That's why I buy these types of games and rent the others.",5.0,B01GW3POY0,BEST TRUE HORROR GAME ever!!!,Video Games
"This is a good Swan Song for the 360 (next to AC Rogue). It has all of the elements of a ""worth the money"" campaign extending for a good 30+ hours. Additionally, there is a high replay factor given the leveling system - changing weapon runes and character upgrades will have dramatic effects on game play. Game play which does not get old given the scalable nature of the upgrades + finishing options. On the down side, the 360 version of this game does suffer from lack of CPU - utilizing the select/start screens is a 5 minute commitment and any cut scenes seem to cycle once or twice before kicking in. Moreover, the Wrath & Ranger dynamic can be confusing in both the story and the game play. There simply is no overlap between the stories or play styles - you will feel like disjointed strangers flip flopping between stealth and frontal attacks. Overall, the story is thin; but, chatting up Golem was enough to keep me interested. It is an interesting game with a lot of quality mechanics; however, the environment (basically Mordor) is barren, desolate and an all around downer.",4.0,B00GMFKYH6,Conan (360) + Thief = Schizo Dead Guy,Video Games

It's not as much fun because it's a serious workout--there are no points to be scored or records to break--but it delivers what it promises.  I use both this and the Wii Fit as the two complement each other well. My Fitness Coach gets me what sessions with a personal trainer would (but for a much smaller investment)--a prescription for workouts that continually challenge my muscles, target certain areas, push me and keep me interested.

Pros:
It pushes you! You let Maya, your trainer, know how hard each series of exercises is for you and she adjusts for future workouts.

Great variety of exercises--you won't get bored! You can choose different focus areas for your workouts in addition to your long-term goal. It incorporates equipment you already have: hand weights, step bench, heart monitor and/or stability ball, which also keeps it interesting.

It's easy to see how the moves are done by watching Maya (although they're probably trickier at first for someone who hasn't done aerobics or dance before.)

You get a continuous workout session as the exercises are pre-selected--you don't have to deal with the menus and such that you do in between activities in Wii Fit.

You can track progress--even in the form of measurements, heart rate, etc. You can also track your other workouts.

It's better than a workout video as the routines are always different and you have a good variety of music and scenery to choose from.

You don't have to have a Wii Fit as it doesn't use the balance board. This is a much less expensive game.

Cons:
I didn't see this in any of the other reviews but the aerobics is not all low impact. I have to be careful with my back so I modify some of the moves to make them low impact--but someone not familiar with the difference may not realize the need or know how to do that.

The tutorials are hard to use except at the beginning of the workout. It could just be me but I don't seem to grab my remote and get it pointed properly in time before the tutorial is grayed out or gone.

The buttons are narrow and can be tricky to click on with the remote.

You do need some room to use this and you need to grab equipment quickly.  I've found that if I get things arranged and handy ahead of time, it's not a problem even though I have fairly limited space.

I wish it had a page that showed all past workouts with time length and focuses--I prefer that functionality on the Wii Fit as it gives me a strong sense of accomplishment and motivation to keep going and logging time.

Overall:  This will give you a solid workout (and probably kick your butt) regardless of your fitness level!",5.0,B001H0RZX2,Great variety of exercises that will make you sweat!,Video Games

"Great game, back when this game came out, a friend of mine was playing this and what's weird was I had no idea what he was playing until I found out he was playing this game, I had almost thought he was playing battlefield but it turns out that it was Far Cry, in my opinion it's kind of hard to play this game especially when you're moving kind of slow and you die so fast.

"I think that pretty much says it all.  From the reviews I've seen here, all of them make perfect sense.  This was a game from Sega that was probably rushed.  Basically, you are a viking warrior, championed by a Goddess to thwart the plans of her 'evil' sister, Hel.  So you go to different islands (not too many... and don't get your hopes up, there are no boats that you use) conquering the lands, learning a few new moves, finding money and doing small tasks.  To me, this wasn't a bad game.  It was relatively short, pretty direct and very easy to play.  It didn't present impossible challenges, though the 'sneaking' missions could be difficult.  Another positive in the game were the battle scenes, which did a decent (though nto spectacular) job at scale of battle.

But what blows is that the game could've been infinitely better if they'd taken more time on the story, some minor bugs and adding more features and details and definitely more options for game-play.  For example, the 'map' you use is pretty bad.  It's not to scale at all.  It makes things look like they're extremely far away, yet when you go back to the game-play, you can sometimes see the very town that looked miles away on the map.  Also... you have to be careful when you're slowly crawling along cliff edges.  My character fell through magical 'solid' rock a few times.  Oh, and the map was terrible at routes, as those mountains made you often run around seemingly to no end.

As for the game-play criticism... I don't think I'm the only one that thought it would have been cooler to have the vikings take-over the camps from the sea.  They just sort of appear there, but there was an opportunity to do something cool, like invade with the viking ships, slaughter what was there before, or even have some battle at sea or at least present some decent cinema.  And as for the battles, while they were ok, more moves for the champion would've been nice and forget about fighting if you or the enemy are on even the slightest of hills.  You'll miss everytime.  And what was the deal with the dragons?  You expected them to at least be able to do something cool with each new one that came up.  But for all you do to summon them, it was kind of goofy and nonsensical to have them unavailable so much.  I won't even get to the last level...

So it's not a terrible game, but definitely a disappointing one in that it could've been much, much, much better. For about 10 bucks though, I suppose you get what you pay for.  Really 2.5 stars.",3.0,B000WCT1KQ,Ok - Could've Been MUCH Better,Video Games

"If you asked me to summarize Prototype quickly, I'd have to tell you that it's a game with a unique plot, but it's not an amazing title that we'll still talk about in ten years. There's nothing terribly wrong with Prototype, but there's nothing particularly amazing- so, I would normally  give it an average rating- 3 stars. However, the gameplay IS pretty fun, so I'm going to give it 4 stars.

Gameplay: What is there to say? You're a superpowered man who can eat people and disguise yourself as them, drive a ton of vehicles than can wreak havok, walk up the sides of buildings, and bash helicopters in with your bare hands. The game is quite fun to play.

Plot: With some ups and downs, Prototype's plot is pretty good. We have a formula that interests the viewer: You wake up with no recollection of what's happened, and you have all these strange abilities. The military is hunting you, and you need to survive while you find out the truth. The plot has cutscenes in which you're talking to a masked character, who is not revealed until later, as you ""recollect"" (play through) events. Combined with the amount of the plot that is gained on the side by finding ""web of intrigue"" targets and consunming them, you find out a lot without having it spoonfed to you. While it's not the quickest way to get a story told, it certainly is an interesting approach, and one that I enjoyed. Points to activision for that.
At the same time, some moments are predictable, and there are some plot points that are...the best way I can describe it is ""meh"". Still, I thought I knew who the final boss would be. I was wrong.

Video: Another area where Prototype has nothing flagrantly wrong, but nothing amazing. Prototype runs at 720P on either console (360 or PS3), it doesn't look bad, but if you look, you can tell. The graphics aren't superb or bad. Unlike inFAMOUS (which I bought at the same time), the city feels pretty generic and boxy. The game has some low quality textures at points, but it is respectable graphically throughout.

Audio: I don't currently have a surround sound system, so I can't speak for directional sound. The music of the game is pretty good, and the sound effects are decent. One particular criticism I have is that the voice acting is of VERY inconsistent quality- like they did everything in one take. There are some lines that are so poorly delivered you have to cringe. The script itself is not too bad though, and the web of intrigue scenes (many) have a ton of voices, so props on variety.

Controls: An area where I will give Prototype props.  The controls are pretty intuitive as a whole, which is great with the amount of havoc you wreak. You'd expect jumping up like Superman and hopping onto a helicopter, ripping the door off, and hijacking it to be hard, but the game does pretty well. It doesn't absolutely baby you, but it's intuitive (with the occasional inevitable bugs).

Length: There's a decent amount of side material and missions to add value to the game. Thankfully, they were able to do so without making the game feel artificially stretched out.

Overall: This game is fun to play, and it's pretty well priced. I can recommend it. It's not a legendary title, but it's a solid title by any means.",4.0,B000WQWPOQ,"Pretty decent, but not all that memorable.",Video Games

"Twilight Princess was one of the first Wii games, and was actually designed for the Gamecube. Skyward Sword, however, was one of Nintendo's *last* first-party Wii games, and it shows in the graphics, gameplay, controls, etc.

Compared to Twilight Princess, Skyward Sword feels more open from the beginning and feels a bit less surreal. On the other hand, it also seems to fall prey to more of the standard Japanese fantasy cliches, such as the story centering around a bunch of kids who are part of a school/academy.

"I grew up playing the Twisted Metal games back on the PlayStation 1. So of course when they announced that twisted metal was coming back.. I lost it. I was just so happy. However David Jaffe: creator of TM said that they were going to be targeting a T (teen) rating for the game, AND that they were only going to have 4 drivers.  I was concerned to say the least. But David later said that they would be dropping the quest to get a T rating, and would embrace the M rating that Twisted Metal truly deserves.

Well here is Twisted Metal... Is it any good... oh HECK yes!.... Could it have been better.... Actually... Yes.

The main reason this game suffers is because this feels lackluster in single player content compared to the master peace that was Twisted Metal: Black (My all time favorite game, aside from Silent Hill 2) My MAIN complaint is.... Why the heck is there only 3 stories?! Twisted Metal: Black had over 15+ stories, and they were all GREAT. Twisted Metal: Black was pretty much an anthology horror movie. But with this new one.. we get 3. Sweet Tooth, and Dollfaces story were great... With Mr. Grim being a been there done that, sort of story.  And if you just played the story straight through you could beat it in well under 3 hours.... I love the way they did the live action / cgi cut-scenes though. I would love to see a real movie!

BUT! Trust me... Where this game shines is in the FLAWLESS gameplay. If you grew up playing twisted metal like I did.. Then you will feel right at home... Plus almost everything is destructible in the game!

If you are on the fence, don't be. With the game being around 20 dollars now.. Do yourself a favor and play this hidden gem. There is NOTHING else like it!",5.0,B00L4KVO78,Twisted Metal Returns! (from a HUGE fan of the franchise),Video Games

"My family is new to the world of the XBOX 360, so I don't have any experience with prior versions of Burnout with which to compare Burnout Paradise. This is my favorite kind of racing game, the kind where you can smash up your car and still keep going.

My son (10) and I did think that the car doesn't show enough damage for our tastes. We have Stuntman Ignition and we spend a lot of time trying to break the back window and have the hood and trunk fall off. It's probably not what most people are looking for in a racing game, but it's what makes it fun for me so I thought I'd note that the back end of the car always looks pristine.

We like the narrator helping us through the parts that are new to us. It's not intrusive and actually much more helpful than making you go through a formal tutorial and then letting you loose on your own.

So, thanks to Creed I know that Ubisoft has the potential to make some really great games that are stunning and fun to play, unlike later COD's, which have grown rather stale. The reason why I guess I pre-ordered this game was due to my love for Far Cry 3 on PS3. Such a great and fun game. Anyway, long story short, I'm very glad I did.

"The Witness has been on my radar ever since the announcement of the Playstation 4.  Right away the bold and colorful world grabbed my attention.  The crazy thing, this entire world is based purely around solving puzzles.  It was quite a bold idea, especially making such a extreme departure from the Jonathan's Blow last game Braid.  The development cycle was long but well worth the wonderfully polished game that was the result.  Built upon a beautiful island, The Witness is a very challenging and rewarding puzzle game that will simulate your brain for hours on end.

The concept seems simple enough.  Scattered around this island is hundreds of panels.  All these panels having a starting point and an ending point.  Its your job to draw a line to connect the two ends.  The challenge is each section of puzzles will throw different obstacles at you.  Just to give  couple examples; this could include separating blocks of different colors, matching up sets of circles, to making specific shapes as you draw your line.  When you enter a new area you'll usually find a sets of five side by side panels that function as tutorials.  This game will never tell you what to do, it instead relies one you to be smart enough to progress.

This game is deceptively straight forward.  There is so much more to this game then just walking from one panel to the next.  There are a series of well hidden bonus puzzles tied to the mysterious black monoliths scattered around the island.  One of my favorite things I found was the movie theater.  The theater itself isn't too difficult to open but you'll need to have truly mastered the various puzzle elements to find the movies.  A boat is available to take you around the island and may help you notice things you may not have seen before.

The amazing artwork combined with the island setting really sets the mood for this game.  You really start to feel like your on a luxurious island retreat.  Pillows and couches can be found lying about inferring that the challenge of these puzzles my make one self tired over time.  Various ledges and buildings will give you breath taking views of the island.  It amazing to see this huge island you've spent hours exploring and conquering seem so shrunken from up high.  Those who crave exploration will want to explore every nook and cranny of this world for its abound with secrets.

I you like to challenge yourself and test your intellect you need to play this game!  The puzzles are numerous and the different sections of the game are superbly designed.  In each area they'll start you off with fairly straight forward puzzles and slowly add more complexity.  By the time you get to the end of a section you'll be amazed at the crazy things you've able to accomplish.  If the puzzles weren't rewarding enough every secret you find will bring a burst of joy and excitement.  The incredibly high ceiling of challenge with no written or spoken tips means that this game isn't for everybody but those who can keep their cool will find a wonderful sense of accomplishment playing through this game.",5.0,B01BMVWT68,A puzzle game that is just as challenging as it is rewarding.,Video Games
"Simply put, this is a great game.  I'm not going to go into the graphics and sound, because you already know they're very good.  What makes this game great is the gameplay.  It is simply one of the best FPS I've ever played.  I rank it right up there with Medal of Honor.
Probably the closest game it resembled that I've ever played is Red Faction. (I'm told it's close to Half Life but I haven't played that one). As the last of a group of super cyborg warriors, you will battle aliens through several different missions and levels.  You will encounter a variety of weapons and vehicles to use to complete your missions.  Although the game primarily takes place as a FPS, when driving a vehicle the perspective is in the third person view.
One of the interesting twists of this game is the fact that at any given time, you can only carry two weapons.  Which means as you find different weapons, you have to make strategic choices about which ones to keep.  A lot of the weapons are really fun to use, (I love the sniper rifle) but often not very practical.  The vehicles can be difficult to control but once you get the hang of it, it will just add to the fun.
The control interface is laid out very well and while awkward at first, you'll soon get accustomed to it and find it very easy to use.  As you progress through the game you will complete checkpoints and you can save the game after any checkpoint.  If you're killed, you're taken back to the last completed checkpoint.  The game has 4 levels of difficulty and even the easy level can be challenging in latter missions.  About 3/4ths of the way through, you'll encounter a new alien group that just puts a whole new twist on the game.
My only real complaint about the game is that a lot of the maps are used over and over, and the levels can be quite long (I played this game for hours) which sometimes leads to getting lost as each room you enter looks EXACTLY like the room you just left.  I would have like to have seen a little more variety.
I've read some reviews where some people complain that the game becomes repetitive and I can't completely disagree with that, but it didn't really seem to matter as the game continues to be fun all the way through.

- the new button layout might confuse you at first but its for the better when you retire the old 3ds Xl
-the 3D in this system is AMAZING and it what it should have been all along  playing it on all the time is really fun now but drains the battery like a V12 engine with max sound and network on .
- the auto brightness feature is also very good on adapting your light surroundings and you can turn it off if you like a pre set brightness as well
- sound might be a bit better but battery life is the same depending on your settings
- the C nob is kinda Meh but it works on JRPGs well enough for camera control but DON'T PRESS HARD ON IT !!!!!!

"This game is a fantastic piece of work for the following reasons:

- Freedom of open-world - allows you to choose how you want to play; side missions or story missions.
- Deep RPG elements - allows you to upgrade your abilities/skills as you see fit.
- Engrossing story - a deep, multi-layered storyline that grabs your attention and makes you want to find out exactly what's going on.
- Superior control - the control mechanics are simple yet deep.

"First a quick description of the product, because honestly I didn't know what I was buying.  I only knew that the bass pedal that came with the game felt terrible, and that it needed to be fixed.  I did a Google search for bass drum pedal mods, and the Pedal Metal was the first hit.  I navigated to the product page on Amazon, and found that ""Billet with Hinge"" was the most expensive (and therefore best, right?) trim of this product.  Without further ado, I plopped down the $30 + shipping.

When this product came, I realized that it was simply two pieces of metal that you screw on to the existing pedal (one on the main part, and one on the heel plate) and a piece of clear plastic.  The piece of clear plastic replaces the hinge that comes with the pedal.  It all seemed kind of strange, and I was wondering why this would be an improvement.  But I figured, hey, sure, why not?

So I proceeded to hack up my pedal beyond any sort of returnable/warranty-able condition and installed this product.  It didn't take very long to install, maybe about 10-15 minutes.  When I was done, I  felt like the improvement in looks would be worth it if nothing else.

Then I started playing.

Wow, what a difference.  The pedal is now very responsive and firm. Now I can actually hit the fast bass drum notes with some sort of consistency and more confidence.  The pedal also feels more durable and solid.  I feel more like I'm playing a real drum set than a children's toy.",5.0,B00133ELQM,A must-have for anyone,Video Games

"I've played every single battlefield since 1942 and just honestly feel let down by this release even after sinking over 200 hours (and after sinking 1000 hours into battlefield 3) into it. I was so excited for this game, that i picked up the 360 version when it came out because i didn't have a PS4 yet and i just wanted to experience the game. I played it and thinking to myself ""Really? this is battlefield?"" thought, well, maybe it'll be better on the next gen consoles. Nope.

Remember how most other battlefield games made you fight tooth and nail to unlock the best weapons and attachments? Well now everyone starts with most of em and the others take all of two hours to unlock.

Remember when battlefield was all about effective teamwork and cooperation? Now, it's 64 people who rarely work as squads, running and gunning and camping in corners with weapons that kill in two or three bullets. I enjoyed battlefield for the strategic game play. I played cod for the fast paced arcade feel. Dice tried to imitate the twitch shooter style of Cod and failed miserably. Oh and remember Squad specs that you could use to help out your buddies. They're gone too and replaced with a system that only benefits you, which just adds to the lone wolf style of play.

Remember when having armor or aircraft on your side gave your team an advantage over infantry? That's gone too. Now 2/3rds of all players are engineers with one of the ten new rocket types that will rip your tank apart and cause your jet to start spinning right into the ground.
Remember when the entire environment was your sandbox to destroy? Now, very few buildings even have destructible walls and you will get caught on odd pieces of landscape every single time you try to vault over something. Instead of bringing every building down until the map is almost flat from the constant explosions as seen in previous games, we have lagolution whereby most maps are changed in some massive but largely useless manner that is aesthetically pleasing but really does not change much in terms of gameplay.
Remember fluid gameplay? Lag. Lag everywhere. Today a guy shot me out of his ass. Don't wanna know how. He was facing the other direction and rounds just started spraying from his pooper. Gotta love it.

Remember partying up with friends to play? That's gone.

Remember being able to change your classes outside of actually being in a game and being able to quickly change to a new gun for your class. Well, now you have to wait for a little personal island to load for you just so you can adjust your classes. Might as well join a game. Oh and wanna try to navigate the menus? Too bad. It's menu after menu after menu.

Like your controls in battlefield 3. Too bad.

Remember when one or two organized squads could effectively change the fate of a game. Well say hello to zulu squad with one man in it and two to three people in most others. Even if you have four buddies and you guys are all working together, it won't make much difference. Prepare to be mobbed by ten people wielding weapons that can kill you with a stray round to the chest or three to the foot.

Remember how awesome sniping used to be? Well say hello to morons trying to quick scope and every single class running around with DMRs. Oh and remember how carbines gave the engineers a crutch to stand on to make up for their lack of specialized anti infantry weapons, well now you get PDWs and everyone gets the carbines! But don't worry, people only use two of them anyways and you start with arguably the best one! Dont even get me started on the useless repair tool. Wanna try to get your buddy in the tank back up to full health. Too bad. It'll take you about five minutes to completely heal something and he's been hit by four rockets by now and you've died in the explosion.
Remember having helpful teammates that would destroy any anti-tank mines they spotted (very few people spot anymore either) so that a teammate wouldn't run over them? Better look out now, because the ground is covered in mines and your team will mostly just ignore them unless they feel especially generous for some odd reason.

I've tried to play the game for what it is but it just isn't battlefield to me. At this point, i'm going to get my last few map packs since i bought premium and then when I've played through those, i'll move onto something else. Hopefully Dice won't fail us with Battlefront. But due to this game, there is no way i'm buying the game right out the door. I'll wait and see what people think. Used to be a die-hard fan for dice who bought every product. Now, just really disappointed.
The only reason i'm not giving this game a 1,is because i like to believe Dice can do better. I like to think EA is to blame for most of the problems, but then i look at the game-play itself, and wonder, what was Dice thinking?  The only redeeming aspect going for them is that Dice is actively (if not slowly) trying to fix the problems in this never-ending beta, so at least they have that going for them.

"Star Ocean: Til the End of Time, which is the third game in the series, but chronically the fifth. Til the End of Time out of the four that I have played is hands down without a doubt the best of the series (I haven't played First Departure). It has for most of the game a really great story (the 4D part was stupid), the battle system is great and so is the voice acting. The characters are really great and most of them are really likable (I feel Pepitia could have been left out), especially Fayt, Cliff, Nel, and Roger, with Roger providing some comic relief from time to time in a game with a have plot. The bonus board is an awesome feature, I love trying to get as many extras as I can without it being broken, and collection the battle trophies (which was a thing before PS3 and 360) is also cool and makes for challenging 100% game complete for completionist.

"I really hated to ding this game a star for ""overall"", because I'm really in love with it. But let's get the bad out of the way first. Graphically, I love the way it looks, but in a retro sort of way. nothing fancy, but gets the job done. The open areas are done well, and some of the buildings are nice, but I found it odd that none of the huge buildings had functional windows. Possibly a limitation of the game engine. I'm having zero problems with the controls. There is a slight adjustment to using them, but the tutorial mission does a great job of training you in quickly. I'm using my 4-year-old Athlon XP2600+ with a gig of ram and a 7800GS video card, and I'm getting good framerates with every option maxed, so it runs very smooth even on lesser hardware.

This game is definitely not for everyone. Each mission requires a great deal of patience to get through. If you're a shooter fan, look elsewhere. This is more akin to a third-person ""Thief"" game, with some major differences. ""Death To Spies"" has an overhead map. And you will be lost without it. The map is moveable and resizeable, so I put mine down in the right corner and made it small. I refer to it constantly, since it shows you the location of each enemy, their direction of travel, which way they are facing, and whether or not your disguise is good enough to fool which ones. Changing uniforms is easy to do. Knocking out the person to get his uniform is less easy, and requires strategy and patience to get them alone somewhere, and then carry the body someplace like a closet without being spotted.

Tension in this game is through the roof, much like ""Thief"". If you are on the fence about this game, I HIGHLY recommend downloading the demo first, which is the first mission of the game. The demo gives a VERY good indicator of what the rest of the game is like. The demo also pulls no punches, and is quite difficult. It took me nearly four hours to complete it, but as in all the missions in this game, there is a HUGE sense of accomplishment upon finishing a mission. Each mission consists of multiple objectives, which you can generally complete in any order, and there is also a huge sense of accomplishment when you hear the clicking typewriter signalling that another objective has been completed. The game is linear only in that you must complete all objectives. How you go about doing that is generally up to you, with a few caveats. Those exceptions though are common sense, and make sense within the gameworld.

There are 10 missions total. I'm currently in Mission 7. The first 4 missions took 2 to 4 hours each to complete. Now that I'm getting more familiar with how the AI works, the last few missions have taken less than 2 hours each.

Totally immersive and utterly involving, you can lose yourself in a game like this. Thankfully, you can save anywhere, save often, and quicksave anywhere you like. The one thing that bugged me most is the lack of a first-person point of view. I generally never touch a third-person game, as I hate having my character block my view, but I can easily overlook that for a game as well-crafted as this one. The level design is outstanding. You can tell that the developers put a lot of love into this creation. I'm eagerly looking forward to a sequel, though that may not be likely since this game is pretty hard-core and may not appeal to the masses. But if you've got patience, and like to sit and stare at the screen, plotting your best plan, and then executing it carefully, then I can give this game a very high recommendation.",4.0,B000RPKCTC,"Not for everyone, but I'm loving it.",Video Games

I turned off the sound because the ""critter"" noises and prompts were too distracting, and I found the songs a bit corny. I also wish there was a way to bypass the so-called bonus rounds.

"You are the newest recruit chosen to become a Dragon Slayer.  You are among the best of the best, selected to be to track down the last of the dragon knights and bring them to justice for their role in killing the divine and enabling Damien to wage a never ending war against the people of Rivellon.

You arrive at the settlement of Farlight and proceed to the ceremony that will finally make you a dragon knight, think Mass Effect Specters, turns out though they leave out one tiny little detail about the process. You gain the wisdom of the dragons, but the transfer effectively blasts out of your brain all the skills that you have learned over the last few years. Which means you now know the secrets of the dragons, but you have a hard time remembering which end of the sword to swing at the enemy.

You are assured that your former skills will return quickly once you start practicing them and you won't be taking on any dragons anyway for quite some time so there is nothing to worry about.  Of course soon afterward there are rumors about a Dragon Knight being spotted flying over a nearby outpost and your superior dispatches you to find out if there is any truth to the rumors.

It turns out the dragon sightings are real and you will be fighting sooner than you thought. Just not on the side you thought or for who you thought....

------------

 I usually like games that don't follow the ""norms"" of the genre and attempt to do their own thing.  Which means I am usually forgiving of rough edges and what have you as long as the game works well enough to be interesting.  This game is also well written which made it easy to ignore some of the mechanics, just so I could see what would happen next.  That was the case with this game until I came to the part, defeating damien's generals, were it was necessary to mostly deal with all the aspects of the game that can be very frustrating when taken by themselves.

At this point I had done everything else that was available up to that point, so I had nothing left to mix in to keep the game play varied and interesting. So my recommendation if you play this game, is in the second half make sure that do a few side quests and then take out a general. Then maybe the game won't grind to a halt like it did for me. Other than that I recommend this game for anyone who likes a rpg with a decent story and tries to do it's own thing, mostly succeeding.

Time Played:
About 30 hours. I got very near the end of the main quest before I hit a brick wall.  I still recommend the game though.

Graphics / Sound:
Not a big deal to me. They do the job, their not going to set any benchmarks.

Game play:
This one is hard.  For the most part everything works. But it's easy to see where they probably had this great idea and then couldn't do it because of budget constraints or technical restrictions. One of the best examples is that in dragon form the player can only attack creatures in the air and not on the ground, but on the ground the player can attack things in the air.  I just get the feeling that everything was supposed to be a lot more fluid and that didn't happen for some reason.  Other than that there are rough edges everywhere, but there are some cool elements like being able to make your own critter from various parts you find lying around and you can also read NPC's minds to get more dialogue options and rewards.

Story:
This is one of those I wish I could have forced myself to finish, If only there was less generals!, because it is interesting and well written. For the most part the quests and the dialogue is not stereotypical and boring.  Some of it made me think and quite a bit of it got a chuckle out of me.  If only...

Only been playing for a couple of days and the races are fun but good lord what is up with the frame rate? How in the world could a racing game of all things make it through testing and quality control and be released with such a ridiculously choppy frame rate?

The graphics are decent and some of the wrecks look great.

"I thoroughly enjoyed this game. I'd played the demo on XBox live but wasn't altogether convinced since the demo was very simplistic. (That only covers the tutorial portion of the game.) This game is about engaging as the games of Elder Scrolls  or Dragon Age series . The customization options are not quite as extensive. Overall, however, there is plenty here for a gamer who enjoys exploration and adventuring.

There were some unique things about this game. I loved that I could fall from any height and not take any damage. That sure made me more willing to be nosy. There are many puzzles in this game so be prepared to think rather than mindlessly mashing buttons to advance.

I only had two gripes. First was the button mapping. Initially I had some problems with the buttons becoming unbound in the middle of a battle. If you hold any button a fraction of a second too long, up pops the mapping screen. I don't know if this is my fault or the fault of the layout.  I also take issue with the long load times. I don't know if this is par for the course for these games, but I did find it frustrating to be twiddling my thumbs waiting for a game to load. Especially after dying. If you are anything like me, you'll spend some quality time dying.

Well I grew up playing video games and I still play them today.  And I figure if there is any way you are ever going to get me to exercise it is probably going to be through playing another video game.

And that is where Your Shape Fitness Evolved 2012 comes in.

I never played the previous game so I unfortunately cannot compare the two.
What I can say though is that I am very impressed by what a video games can do in terms of giving you a good workout.

I have had issues with other Kinect games for the Xbox 360 not picking up my body or not recording my actions, but I did not have this problem with this game.

I found the key to be sure to be at least 8 feet back from your television and give yourself plenty of clear space to move.

Other reviewers have a done a great job of describing the specific exercises and programs.  They are real workouts that use your whole body.  My only complaint and I have this with many exercise games is that the game doesn't really ""tell"" you what to do in a fitness program.  Instead you just set a goal and are then left to your own devices to fulfill it.  I would really enjoy a game that could offer me some expert advice as to how to work out and what kind of exercise would best benefit me.

"I am currently replaying Daikatana and I decided to go write a second review. I still stand by my 5 star rating, despite the ignorance abundant in some of the reviews of this game. While Daikatana is no Halflife by any means, it is still one of the of the best games ever made. But I do have some critisms to add since my last review. Two major problems in Daikatana, although the patch eliminates one and greatly reduces the other.  The first thing is as some have stated, the crashes. I have only noticed them in the Norway levels especially around or in the scene with the sorceror in Wynthrax Tower. There has to be a bug in the game at that point because it is a pain getting past the sorceror when the game keeps freezing right after I have beaten him. The other critism is the A.I.  I think the characters and voices are excellent, even if Superfly Johnson is a cheesy name. But the problem lies in not the performance of the A.I.  Now one review said the A.I was horrible which simply isn't true. The A.I is excellent compared to most games, and I didn't notice any enemies standing around, they were all coming straight at me. But the problem with the A.I though is that the game is too dependent on the sidekicks to progress, it gets to be very cumbersome to keep up with them at times and they have the tendency to dissappear and not come back at times. There is a cheat code that allows you to respawn them but it's useless since it always says they are still somewhere in the level when you use it.  But in defense of Mikiko and Superfly they really kick...when they are fighting alongside you and saved me...quite a few times. Overall Daikatana is an excellent game with excellent graphics and a fresh, original, and totally engrossing storyline.  I really really hope there is a sequal.",5.0,B00001ZT47,Excellent Game!,Video Games

"Many reviewers have made mention of the civ games and certainly there is an element of that you don't find in almost any other RTS that is not a reason to buy this. It's my belief and i could be wrong that this is the first microsoft RTS to span the whole epoch of human history. AOE was limited to certain eras starting obviously with ancient civilizations in AOE 1 but empire earth came out with a game that spans them all and that is the main object of this game.

In this game you could literally start at the stone age and advance all the way to the space age. A skirmish can begin in any era you want so C&C fans like me can only play a modern game. I like that.

This has been called the thinking man's RTS but that doesn't mean other great RTS games are mere not sophisticated enough. Most people simply don't have the hours of time available to understand every nuance of a game. Most of the time you just want to play, gather money-resources, build an army and go. This unit counters or is vulnerable that unit. C&C games are that way. I would have never complained that RTS games are not sophisticated enough.

The good thing about RON is that it takes little time and resource to get an army up and rolling. Right away you can make various plants for creating various units. The units themselves look ok but not a sharp and clean as in generals but good. Buildings are the same way. The maps and terrain look fantastic.

Pros:

You can fight in any age.

Great skirmish maps

Full variety of military units available-ground-air-naval

Huge variety of upgrades and technologies.

You can build a sizable military very quickly.

Civ type feature adds another element not found in other RTS.

Cons:

Games take too long, often hard to finish an opponent. Somtimes as little as 30 units and a few defensive structures can hold off an opponent until reinforcements arrive.

Game takes longer to learn than most RTS.

Poor or nonexistent single player campaign

Overall this is a solid RTS and a great value. My second fav RTS to C&C generals and a game i like more than empire earth 2 or warcraft 3. If you take the time to learn it you will get your investment repaid many times over..",5.0,B00008KA4E,Better than empire earth...,Video Games

"I had purchased this 16MB's Playstation 2 memory card back on August-5-2011, at the time I was thrilled with my purchase. But as time has gone on, I have become less and less thrilled with this memory card. Don't get me wrong here folks, it has been a very reliable memory card, and unlike some here who purchased this and got some  other card instead, I did indeed get the one in the picture. But for me the achilles heel of the card is that gosh darn button! Your sitting there on your sofa, very comfortably and you stick a game in your system, all to come to find out you got reach back over again to press a small button on the memory card, because your game saves are on the other page of the card. Personally speaking, it would have been even nicer if the manufacturer could have built this card to be a true 16MB, not 2 8MB's built into one memory card. Again, very reliable, rugged and to this days it works great. But I am no longer going to use it as a primary memory card anymore. I just bought a sweet 64MB's here on Amazon.com and copied all the saves from the 16MB's over to the new card, as well as 5-6 8MB cards, leaving me a total of around 54MB's of data storage space on the new memory card. That is kind of what I wanted with the 16MB card from the get go, the ability to save without the worry or need to change pages within the memory card. So now the 16MB card is my back up copy of what I have on it, for in case the new 64MB card goes out or get's lost, I still have the saves.",3.0,B000WE8JES,Had To Throw In The Towel With This Memory Card,Video Games

"Tenchu 2 was once claimed to be the goriest game of all time. In many ways it lived up to the hype with its stealth kills. Tenchu 3 turns up the graphics, gameplay and stealth kills by a factor of 10 and then some more. Hopping across roof tops with your ninja blade looking for the enemy to perform a drop down standing on shoulders head through jaw thrust or a heart pull just makes this game a lot beyond want you have seen on the PS2 before. By the time the credits roll you would have been through a Ninja experience like-no-other. I can't believe how fierce this was to play. There is nothing, and I mean nothing, out there that plays quite like this. Imagine Solid Snake in MGSIII but with ninja skills. The game is as good as that.

Note: I am very surprised by the 15 cert on the game. It looks like whoever reviewed this game for content advisory probably didn't perform all the moves correctly.

"This is one of the most underrated series. Since I really liked the first and the second game, I gave this one a try as well. Here is what I thought.

*******************************************************************PROS*************************************************************************
Unique FPS gameplay with very unique weapons: This is the best aspect of the game. Weapons are the best aspect of the game. Each weapon comes with primary and secondary fire. They range from rifles that can tag and track the enemies to the ones that can shoot through the walls. Really enjoyable.

Amazing Story/Campaign: I was quite surprised by this. I found story to be interesting in the previous games but this game probably has the best story of all. It is quite personal to the main character and at the same time also ties things to what is happening in the alternate history of the world where alien chimera is taking over the earth.

Strong character portrayal: The voice actors have done amazing job conveying the story. A great incentive to move forward in the game.

Gorgeous graphics and nice music: The best graphics in all of the three games and the music goes well with them. Makes your journey quite enjoyable.

Enemy design: While all of the enemies look like chimeras, there is decent variety of them from small grunts to big chimeras to zombie like chimeras. Makes you think hard about what strategy to use.

Multiplayer: I didn't explore much, but liked what I played.

"Before you accuse me of not playing game much I've beat all 4 campaigns all the way through on all 7 characters in campaign mode and got all Serpent emblems on Leon and 4/5 of Chris campaign.  This game is just horrible overall.

i've seen portions of body disappear when you shot no where near part like should and part of guys head disappears when i shot him in stomach.  Agent Hunter Mode I was turned into a lizard after i got killed.  well he killed me again and it spawned me below map i fell down 150 meters below map before it killed me so i could respawn.  attacks on agent hunter mode are so slow.  the controls took a big crap from RE5 to RE6. I think RE6 controls are just as good as RE4 for PS2.  Jake Campaign for example.  when you get chased down that hallway by the Tank it changes camera angle at the end you press right but damn thing moves left.  Ada campaign at the start if your not into physical attacks it starts off uber hard for you.  but than becomes super easy once ya reach chapter 2+.  The Bow I mean what a joke not even worth trying to use on campaign mode. you'll have to keep backing up as you shoot 1 arrow at a time and reload takes forever.  I had 1 attempt at supposedly trying to merge lobbies on one of the parts where Leon/Helena met up with Jake/Sherry and it failed i lost my partners connection as well.  Hackers 5 days ago had hacked scores so they have 999,999 scores on mercenaries and its just got worse.  How are they supposed to do the events that they have if people hack there scores so they win the events?  I have yet to meet many american players also.  I've ran into a ton of Japanese and German players with mics.  Mercenaries mode needs to bring in stronger monsters gradually not all at once. and finding the zombies in merc is a joke you can't be near each other or you'll lose the combo even with combo bonus ability. what happens when zombies get a cheap hit and partner needs help you can't reach him.  When I saw agent hunter mode you know what I thought? I thought I'd get to control a boss monster and try to kill players that'd be sweet but NOOO you only get a low level guy to try to kill them with what a disappointment.  some of the trophies are a pain to get liek in dieing state kill something and than recover without being helped lol.  o yeah to unlock some abilities you need to kill 800-1500 800 bow kills lol it takes like 3 shots to kill 1 guy poor anyone who tries this will take forever.

"My first experiences with SimCity as a franchise began with SimCity 4. I thoroughly enjoyed the game and played it for hours on end. When I heard a new SimCity was in the works I was thrilled. I immediately pre-ordered then subsequently bought it. Day 1 - 6 I could not log in to play the game due to EA's always-on DRM nonsense. That SHOULD have given me a clue what was to come...

By day 7 I was able to log in and begin playing with two friends of mine. We immediately noticed that when we bought a resource, electricity  for example, it would pay the person who was providing the resource but the person buying it would not have funds deducted. It was like the money was appearing from thin air. This, in our minds, compromised a real ""city simulation."" Strike one...

Traffic, oh sweet mercy, the traffic. Even after multiple attempts at different road layouts and millions sunk into mass transit we could  not prevent traffic from becoming an issue in every one of our cities. A domino effect ensued. Because traffic was bad firetrucks could not reach burning buildings, school buses had trouble picking up kids, garbage trucks couldn't pick up garbage, and so on. Mid to late game all of our cities were in chaos. It felt like an exercise in futility to build a city at all. Strike two...

Somehow, I managed to keep a city alive and well when I played single player. I had maybe logged 10 - 12 hours in this city before I encountered an error so many others have: ""Unable to load the city at this time. Please try again later."" Strike three, I'm out...

At time of this post SimCity is on version 1.8. With the current lack of improvement I have seen patch-by-patch it will be version 3.0 before SimCity is fully functional. Do not pay anymore than $10 for this game until has been HEAVILY updated. Do your research; read the official forums and the subreddit.

"After having a few xboxs through the years, i bought the arcade version for my mother(Viva Pinata freak) and the pro for myself. One thing that was odd is that she played VP on my pro system and when hooked up to the HDMI at 1080p it looked far superior than any of the old systems that i use to have. Sure they looked great but the new system looked more colorful and vibrant than any i had seen, i work on computers so i read into to things, sometime a little to deep. Well, i noticed when i went to play PURE and RE5 on the arcade version(with my hard drive on it), that on the same TV at 1080p it was fuzzy and the colors didn't look nearly as sharp. First i thought it was just me, or my eyes, well come to find out after reading on a website a LOT of the arcade versions still have the older Falcon chipset in them, even ones made in 09!! It went on to say you may notice a difference on many HDTVs at certain resolutions that pictures may be dull, or colors may look washed out due to this fact. Afterwards it stated that the new jasper chipset not only fixes the RROD problem but also the HDMI output has been improved and modified for better picture quality on all new HDTVs. Never had i heard of such a thing but its true, so if you get an arcade version, you may wanna remember that, i would say 90% of people wouldnt notice any difference while hard core gamers like myself could see if largely.

"Lair looked like a dream come true.  what would be better than controlling a huge dragon roaring around destroying armies and winning huge battles?  Unfortunately, it seems this game is not all it's chalked up to be.  Don't get me wrong, this game is great in a lot of ways, it just falls short in many ways.  ill split this into 5 categories.  lets begin with

music:

the score is awesome, and charged with emotion.  it is one of the best soundtracks in a game i have seen, and it rarely breaks from a good flow.  the blu ray tech is well utilized here.  there is even a ""concert hall"" included on the extras on the disc in which you can listen to individual tracks.  a good part of the game.

gameplay:

the gameplay, while fun at times, is quite clunky and useless.  even after applying the patch to use the analog stick for control, it still feels laggy and delayed.  the semi-quicktime battle sequences are cool-looking, but not very well thought-out.  overall, much work could have been done to make this bit better.

story:

sometimes fairly obvious, with the occasional plot twist, it feels as though the story was tacked on.  it doesnt really need to be there, and maybe this game would have been better suited for online or free-roaming play.  it does get interesting at times, but feels very disconnected.  the game creators boast that they have to do more work than movie directors, but in reality this is not the case, and the game rarely impresses.

graphics:

well, it is 2012 now, and the graphics in lair have aged like a glass of milk left out for a week.  looking back, this game was supposed to be a epic showcase of the power of the PS3, and while it does manage to do much more than could ever be imagined on a PS2, it seems the resources of the new playstation are simply stretched too thin to really output amazing graphics.

1080p output? check.  hi-poly dynamic scaling dragon models? check.  breathtaking water and architecture? check.

despite touting all of these features, the game never seems to deliver them all at the same time.  the fact is, choosing to display at 1080p meant sacrificing the rest of the visuals.  dragons look nice close up, but once they fly slightly away from you, the models quickly scale down to super-low-res versions that move slowly and are not at all realistic.  this same principle holds true for all other models in the game, including ships, creatures, buildings, and terrain.  Lair does deliver a huge world with epic battles, but anything not close to you begins to look like a character from a game on NES (very old).  on the flip side, the water still looks amazing, even today.  unfortunately, as you fly closer to it, it never scales up, and it looks horrible.  the same goes for the soldiers on the ground.  whether there are 10 or 1000, they all react exactly the same to your presence, and are basically all little clones of each other.  it is also notable that the game quite often drifts from the target 30 frames per second, and when certain things happen on screen, the game becomes choppy.  it never gets too bad, but it lowers the immersiveness of the whole experience.

maybe if lair was delivered on the PS4, with an overhauled control system and game engine, it would be a 10/10 game.  unfortunately, that is not the case.  As it is, lair is a delicacy that might only be enjoyed by people who truly want to love it.  it is ambitious, and is really the only game that plays like it does.  unfortunately, there are issues that prevent if from being enjoyed by the masses, and so it will always be relegated to being a novelty.  I enjoyed lair, however, and i hope you do too!",4.0,B000K9OR4Q,A polarizing mixed bag of epic and fail,Video Games

"The original Tomb Raider was a landmark game for the Playstation and the start of a very long running series. It holds up well, but is a definite acquired taste.

Tomb Raider begins with adventurer and treasure huntress Lara Croft being hired by business woman Jacqueline Natla to search an ancient cavern in Peru for a piece of the Scion, an ancient talisman of great power. However, after finding the piece, Lara is betrayed by Jacqueline's men. Now it's a race across the world to find the remaining pieces of the Scion before Jacqueline attains its mythical power. Tomb Raider is an early Playstation game, and unfortunately the graphics haven't aged very well. Although many set pieces in the game are very impressive all the levels tend to feel very samey. Despite this the game's length is impressive. There are over fifteen massive levels with hidden caches of ammo and first aid packs, giving you a great sense of exploration throughout the game. Lara moves in a very stiff fashion. Her controls are tank-like and You have to hold down a button for her to walk. She takes very long jumps, but running jumps have a delay that requires you to plan your jumps ahead of time in most cases. Fortunately there is a training mission where Lara instructs you on how to play in her home. The game is primarily a puzzle platformer. Each level contains a series of puzzles that will test your problem solving skills.

Scattered throughout the many ruins and caves are vicious animals and hired goons all chomping at the bit to impede your progress. This is where combat comes into play. Lara starts off the game with twin pistols that have unlimited ammo. Through out the game you will find a variety of firearms, however these weapons do have limited ammo, but the pistols ensure you will always have a fighting chance in battle.
The last gameplay feature to talk about is the process of saving your game. The PC version of the game allowed the player to quicksave wherever they wanted. The console versions of the game on Playstation and Sega Saturn do not have this luxury. You can only save with the use of crystals that are placed along the path you are intended to follow. Unfortunately, once a crystal is used it is gone. This makes it really difficult when you've got a very long stretch ahead of you and not much health. Some areas have multiple crystals forcing you to carefully plan how often you save.

This game has many flaws, but it is a very rewarding experience. I would recommend the game for those expecting a challenge. The later games in the Tomb Raider series ironed out many of the issues experienced here. If you're curious about the beginning of the franchise you won't be disappointed, but maybe a little stressed.

For classic PC gamers I'd recommend Tomb Raider: Unfinished Business. This is the original game plus two bonus missions with two new levels a piece.",4.0,B000006RGS,Begin The Treasure Hunt!,Video Games

The Bad: Even though there is a variety the core game play doesn't change much, a bit too difficult in spots, way too short

I was really excited about this game because it was the first of its kind, for the Wii, to utilize the Zapper (and any other 3rd party light gun attachments) to make you feel like you're really shooting things. While we can't use the Zapper for RE4 this sure does work. While the game is on rails and it moves around for you it makes a great cinematic experience and the difficulty stays about the same throughout but can sometimes get a bit too tough in spots.

The game has you playing through important sections of previous RE games and it's a great blast to the past. For fans of the series it's wonderful to go back and have certain scenes trigger memories. While the newer RE games aren't present the others are and you can even play sections of the game that you couldn't in the original such as playing as Albert Wesker in RE1. You can upgrade your weapons, shoot objects in the game to find hidden files, and you are rated after each mission.

There are even some sequences where you have to press buttons during key sequences like in RE4. The boss fights are really fun because each one is different and they all have their own way of having to be beat. The controls are pretty simple and easy (especially on the Zapper). There are plenty of enemy types, weapons and so forth to use.

I find that REUC is one of the best arcade style games on the Wii and shouldn't be passed up. The game is short mind you and isn't worth nearly $50 but as soon as the price drops it'll be a steal.",4.0,B000P297F2,One of the best shooters on the Wii,Video Games

"Was recommended this keyboard by a user at PC Part Picker, while it looks good online, the fact that the keys are dark and not backlit actually make it much more difficult to use than I had thought. The keyboard is responsive and you are getting some nice value, but a couple months in, I'm already looking at replacing this keyboard for a higher end keyboard.

Your keyboard is one of the major parts you interact with on your computer, and were I to do it again, I would have picked a different Razor model.",3.0,B00HKEI4HU,Don't Skimp on Your Keyboard,Video Games
"Ok, I'm 30 years old and wasted a good part of my life playing the last two Grand Theft Auto games and loved them. This one I've been playing for three days and am ready to pack it in already.  Why?  The game doesn't seem any different than Vice City so there's nothing really cool and new.  The main problem I have is the character, you're this gangster punk who wears his pants down by his underwear and cusses every 20 seconds.  I felt like shooting myself after seeing this loser.  I know it's weird but it's nice to relate to the character, this one is worthless.",3.0,B0001VGFK2,"Ok, maybe I'm getting too old",Video Games

I have not experienced the stair casing that others have but the vertical movement of the mouse while  moving the  left analog stick is terribly slow to the point I can't use the controls for what I bought it for.

I spent quite a bit of time getting the settings right but it still doesn't make the vertical movement of the mouse any better.

To be honest I am quite disappointed with the performance of the controller.

"This game reminds me of GTA3 in the graphics department.  But that's not really a bad thing.  If you enjoyed the GTA titles so far, then you will enjoy this one as well.  Last night I got the second island of the game's storyline.  So far it's been pretty enjoyable other than the way too often foul dialog.  So far, there are motorcycles, mopeds, choppertype motorcycles, cars, trucks, and now I found some boats to cruise around in as well as some sports cars.  I am hoping to be able to fly helicopters as well...assuming they are later in the game.  The in-game music barely cuts it though.  Just cruising around the islands are still enjoyable.  All in all, I recommend this title to those of a mature audience only...not for the kids due to language, violence, and sexual content.",4.0,B000F0GX8I,Pretty good,Video Games

"This console is pretty good. It has a decent selection of games but most of them lean toward younger children, that is the way Nintedo has always been and will always be, but that's great for the kids. If you're a bit older, and looking for some mature games that aren't geared torward the pre-10 year old crowd, the system has a few but very little in that category, maybe a handful or more. GC lacks heavy 3rd party support and the little it does have, make a few mature titles but are usually quick cash ins with little substance. But there are a couple good ones to be found, just very miniscule compared to the other consoles on the market.
The system itself is very small, and that's great for fitting it in tight spaces. Very durable as well. The system doesn't play DVD movies or music CD's though, just a special mini disc that play the games for the system. If you want a game console that plays games, DVD's and CD's, then this isn't what you're looking for, you'd be better with a PS 2 in that case.
The gamepad is great though. Very comfortable but the button layout is a bit akward for certain games, but overall it's good. It also has 4 gamepad ports so 4 player games are definitely fun. But it does not include a modem, harddrive and the memory cards have very little save space that get filled up quickley with certain games, so expect to buy many memory cards down the road.
The graphics and sound are also impressive, and most games have very fast load times. The system does not have an optical(toslink) output like the PS 2 does, but it is capable of prologicII whch sounds great, although not quite as nice as DTS/5.1.
Overall, a nice system, but limited in terms of features such as DVD, CD, and 5.1 playback and also very limited in variety of games, and mostly geared toward children. It also does not have an online structure, so you will not be playing games online for quite awhile if at all. But it is perfect for a child that just wants a bare bones console that has some excellent and fun  games for their age.",3.0,B00006JZC5,good system for young ones,Video Games

"Overall, you NEED to be wireless really.  After all, why not be?

It comes with two AA Alkaline batteries.(At least mine did.)  Personally, I did buy the ""Plug N' Play"" rechargeable battery pack with the cord to plug it in when it needs chargeing; however, I now use rechargeable batteries instead.

I felt their official battery pack needed to be charged too often.  So I went with my preffered brand of rechargeable batteries and I've never looked back.  Just in case you're wondering what I decided to use, I use Rayovac 15 minute rechargeables.  I keep an extra pair of regular Alkaline AA batteries for when I need to charge them.  Still have the original pair of Alkaline AAs that I started with too. ;P

PROS:

1.  It's wireless.

2.  Can easily last up to 20 hours before needing a new pair of batteries.

3.  You can walk around and get something from the fridge without setting down the controller so you can also continue talking to friends if you're online.

CONS:

1.  The batteries lasting up to 20 hours really only happens if you don't have anything like the headset plugged in.  The headset really drains it alot more.  Who knows how much the QWERTY keyboard add-on will drain!

2.  You can NOT use it on your computer as there is no USB cable to connect it with.

3.  Like all controllers in existence, it gets dirt in the groves that should be periodically cleaned out.

P.S. Just search for ""Rayovac 15 minute"" if you wanna find the same AA batteries I use and the charger.  You'll save ALOT of money overall!  Not to mention, as a side benefit, if you care about the enviroment you're helping it since it's that many fewer alkaline batteries in the dump. ;P",5.0,B000B6MLUA,Pretty Good!,Video Games
"I got the game on the release day and 14 days later, I had logged 110 hours. Which says a lot for a guy working full time.

I got sucked in. I couldn't help it. I couldn't put it down. It had so much nostalgia in it I didn't even know where to start.  It reminded me of the classics essentials of the Square Soft JRPG.

Yes, there are grinding.  Yes, there are challenging bosses, and yes, there are awesome rewards.
On the high level, ""Brave"" and ""Default"" are just ways to spend and accumulate ""action points"" in battle.  This ""action point"" system isn't new, as other JRPG's have had it before, but this game is able to make battle system so fluid it is eye-opening and refreshing.

Quick summary:
+ Refreshing battle system!
+ Likeable characters!
+ Deeply customizable battles!
+ Rewarding battle reward system!
+ Play with your left hand!
+ Job system!
+ Lovely hand-drawn environment!
+ Remarkable sound track!
-

There are so many great things about this game besides the ""Bravely"" and ""Default"" --
+ Characters are so likeable!  Each is unique with great and rich personality. I love how the main characters interact with each other as well as every secondary characters. Whenever the old hermit pops into the story, I laugh with joy. :)

+ Deeply customizable battles!  If you don't want random encounters, set the encounter rate to -100% to turn them off completely!  If you like challenges, set to Hard difficulty to fight enemies with tons of HP.  Press Y to enable auto-battle so the last set of commands get repeated.  Press Right on the D-Pad to speed up the battle speed (up to 200%+ speed) so grinding is a lot more likeable!  There is even an accessory that helps if you want even higher random encounter rate.  As a matter of fact, I have been proudly playing with +100% encounter rate on Hard since the first minute. For a good duration of the game, I have been wearing the +100% encounter rate accessory for a brutal +200% encounter rate Hard difficulty battles.  It was fun and rewarding but it was brutal... 1 encounter every 3 steps was a little too much. :)

+ Rewarding battle reward system! Defeat all enemies in a single turn for a reward boost. Defeat all enemies without taking damage for another reward boost. Wipe all enemies with 1 shot (usually magic) for yet a different reward boost.  Getting the same reward boots after 5 battles and the reward goes to 10% to 20%. Getting them 10 in a row boosts the rewards to 50%!  Now you see why I had been playing with the +100% to +200% encounter rate... ;-)

+ Play with your left hand!  Left on the D-Pad to cancel (replaces A button), Right on the D-Pad to confirm (replaces B button), configure L and R buttons to quickly issue Brave or Default commands in battle.  I have had the chance to enjoy a great number of JRPGs but I have yet to find one so thoughtfully laying out the control for you so you get to free your right hand during gaming.

+ Job system! For those who have played Final Fantasy Tactics, you must experience this game! It's a joy that you can change jobs freely to receive all sorts of stat boosts. Level up each job to unlock abilities so you get to mix-and-match those with other jobs.

+ Hand-drawn lovely environments and details! One of the most notable things about the environment is details -- when you first stepped out of the starting inn and stood for two seconds, the camera zoomed all the way out to the entire city and you felt the grand scale and the vision the game sets you up for.  As you walk, you see citizens as well as small critters scattered around the city. They may not be doing much, but you feel immersed and you feel ""real"". :)

+ Remarkable sound track!  Whether you are strolling under the sun in a small city or in the heated boss fight, the sound track is just right.

+ Play in Japanese!  My game was bought in US but it allowed me to play in Japanese voice with Japanese text! I was thrilled to have this as an option!

There are a few things I don't quite like, such as some portionf of the story and how some of the side quests are overly long while others are surprisingly short.  Over all I am thoroughly enjoying it, and just now taking a short break to reflect and write this review (hopefully I could get more poeple to enjoy this great game after seeing all these positive reviews).

"Overall this games is very similar to 2001. They used the same autorun and main game interface that they used in 2001, but they spiffed it up. The close up view is really neat though. Plus you can make your own logos and field logos for your customized teams which is really cool. The flaws to this game are the fact that it does not work well with 2k or Xp. It says its compatible with 2k, but its (not). I have 2k with a GeForce 3 64 mb DDR and the menu is slow as hell and takes forever to load. Oh and god forbid Madden and Pat say a few more things and sound a little less Corny. I have nothing against John Madden or Pat Summeral in real life I believe they are the best color commentators in the game, but in Madden 2002 they sound (bad).

Vito takes a shot, comes home, and picks up where he left off in his life of crime. Mobsters, cars, big cash and loose women provide all he wants. For now anyway.

One little trick I learned on youtube that some kid posted. Not really a SPOILER,but some might think so.
After doing your first job, you can go back to the scapyard to crush up cars for fast bucks! There are always two cars parked near the crusher. After you crush the two cars, run past the shack and 2 wooden  horses, down the lane until you past the long brown box on the left. Then run back toward the crusher and 2 more cars will be there! You keep doing that until the crusher jams shut. You can drive off the yard and drive up the street, then go back and the crusher is open again. You get over $400 a car.",3.0,B000ZK698C,"Liked it alot, didn't fall in love with this one!",Video Games
"This is the kind of game that sets a new standard for innovation in gameplay. Thief has a great plot, and very original gameplay. You have to think like a thief in this game to have any chance of surviving. Your  supply of weapons is definitely NOT for head on confrontations. There is  something very satisfying about sneaking up on someone and simply knocking  them over the head with your blackjack. Who would think that not  splattering someone all over a wall(like every other FPS out there)would be  so fun? But it is. The only real flaws of this game is the AI and some of  the enemies that you have to face. First, the AI is fine most of the time,  but can be very quirky at times, such as not noticing you when you are  making enough noise to annoy a jackhammer operator or noticing you when you  are silent and still in complete darkness. The other flaw is that in a few  levels you have to deal with creatures that can see you in the dark and  also can't be knocked out. This is annoying because the greatness of this  game comes from sneaking around. This seems to be a common complaint and  has been addressed in the sequel. Despite these flaws, this is one of the  best overall games for the PC on the market today.",5.0,B00002CF94,Original and extremely fun.,Video Games

"I didn't expect there to be any kind of light humor to this game, but there's plenty of laughs to be had along with the harsh and realistic storytelling involved with this game.  Of course, when I say ""realistic"" I mean in terms of how humans tend to be imperfect beings capable of making the most foolish mistakes.

People who have played and enjoyed Drakengard will understand the quirky atmosphere this game has to offer, and would come to appreciate the well-woven story that comes with it.

"I will rewrite this review if Razer support ever gets back to me,
Currently I've been waiting 3 days for them to call me since they've escalated my issue to tier 2 because they don't know how to fix my issues.

Issue #1  Firmware doesn't work.  Keeps telling me No Razer Naga Epic connected, and closes on me.
Tech support doesn't know how to fix, still waiting on tier 2 to call me as they claim they would to resolve my issue.

Issue #2  If I ever use it wireless, it randomly stops working.  It takes about 5 minutes to start working on it's own, or if I connect it to the usb cable it takes a minute to connect IF that worked, sometimes that doesn't work and I have to disconnect it and reconnect it again.

 I've gone over this with tech support, and according to them there is no reason this should be happening, there's no issues they see with my computer.  I'm frustrated, and tired of waiting for them to contact me on an issue that they should have contacted me back on within one day.
I will give it 2 more days and if not contacted back by then, I will be returning it and not getting another one.

I love razer, but maybe it's time I start looking into another brand.

@Razer support, before you give me your copy and paste ""please contact us"" You should read my issue and see that I already have contacted Razer support, they've escalated my issue and I've been waiting.

Edit:
So it turns out I will not be changing my 1 star rating on this item.
Razer Support promised me tier 2 will be giving me a call a few days ago, and instead of a phone call I receive an email saying I should contact Amazon Support and request a refund.  This is the 2nd non-functioning razer mouse I've received, and being told by a company that you should ask for a refund instead of them trying to keep your business or offer any troubleshooting steps is extremely frustrating.

I've had a few problems thusfar in Lords of the Fallen with the left bumper and my shield just not staying up.

In layman's terms, basically the bumper is hard to reach and a hard press, and it's primarily the controller design as the reason for it, and not a hardware issue. Bear that in mind before purchasing if you're upgrading from an xbox 360 controller to this.

"This keyboard was purchased for a home theater PC and works exceptionally well considering the cost and user-intended use.  The battery life is respectable, the unit is of passable build quality, and the reception range and signal reliability are impressive.  All this with a built-in touchpad.

You may ask why did I choose a PS3 keyboard for a PC?
- Bluetooth keyboards on PC's are rather expensive and more so when you are looking for a built-in touchpad.
- Few choices of products when searching for keyboard+touchpad combos
- Logitech makes the DiNovo Mini and Edge but these are rather expensive - and they have their issues.
- Wireless keyboard/mouse combos (non-Bluetooth) are notoriously short on reception range and unreliable (missed keystrokes)

The PS3 keyboard is fully functional with a PC and half the price of other alternatives (that are of unknown vendors and trash quality)

The highlights of the keyboard are:
- Value (contrasted to similar Bluetooth keyboard + touchpad sets)
- Bluetooth support (range, reliability)
- Touchpad (same as a laptop touchpad)
- Keyboard-based left and right mouse buttons on both sides of the keyboard (perfect for true ""laptop"" use)
- Touchpad-based scrolling
- Lightweight
- Acceptable build quality
- Acceptable battery life
- Software support is absolutely basic (No bloatware, Windows 7 does support this product)

The cons:
- Designed for a PS3 (No windows key but you can just use Ctrl+Esc)
- No backlighting (for use in low-light)
- Gloss plastic (fingerprints)
- Software support is absolutely basic (Might be an issue for some)
- Unknown if it can survive a drop to a hardwood floor (and I'm not going to test this out)
- Unit does not appear to shut off automatically
- Weak documentation (use standard Bluetooth procedures to install the unit)

"I knew little about the fallout series before I played this game. Since Fallout series was popular and this game received great reviews , I decided to give it a shot. After finishing it (60+ hrs w/o DLCs; 80+ hrs with all 5 DLCs), here is what I thought.

**********PROS.**********

LONG, JUST VERY LONG AND ENTERTAINING RPG: These days when most of the games (even RPGs) are 10hrs, it was a rejuvenating experience to play this long RPG. Just like other RPGs and games in general, while some elements were redundant, it has plenty of variety to offer as you progress in the game. Even after playing 50+ hrs (not even touching the awesome DLCs), there were always exciting and unexpected events in the game. Great job Bathesda, great job.

CHOICES, CHOICES, CHOICES: In this game, just like Mass Effect and Bioshock, you will have to make choices, lots and lots of them. And each choice you make will have major consequence on the outcome your missions and game all together. Again wonderful job. There will be time you will make a choice, finish the mission,  get the results and out of curiosity replay the same mission again (assuming you saved before the mission), to see what outcome you might have gotten if you were to make a different choice.

KARMA METER: The choices you make will give you extremely positive to extremely negative karma. And different karma will change behavior of people of wasteland towards you allowing you to do different missions, unlock different achievements and different rewards. Depending on the choices you make, you will turn certain groups into your friends and others into enemies. Words simply can't describe the experience. You have to play it get the feel for what I am saying.

OPEN WORLD: Yes you are free to roam in wasteland and go wherever you want to go. I personally loved it. While to progress in the story you have to go to specific places on the map. You can take whatever route you can take and complete whichever missions you like.

SURPRISES WHILE ROAMING IN OPEN WORLD: This was one of the strongest aspect of the game. While roaming in open world and exploring new areas and wastleland towns, you never know what you are going to encounter. While a lot of open world games have the same type of enemies and areas in open world, this game will introduce to plenty of varieties. Can't tell more without spoiling.

RPG ELEMENT: As you defeat enemies, complete missions, solve conflicts and progress through game, you gain experience and level up. Leveling up will allow you to enhance your traits and unique abilities (for example, your aiming, your melee power, unique abilities like  your conversation skills, atomic explosion when you are damaged enough etc.)

COMBAT MECHANICS: The game is First Person Shooter for most part, but it has unique combat mechanic.  While playing FPS, you can freeze time so do speak and target specific enemies part for higher damage of decapitate them. This can make game very strategic as some enemies faster or bigger than others and sometime enemies can have devastating weapons. So if you use this time freezing and aiming trait well you can target specific body parts or their weapons and slow them down.

VARIETY IN ENEMIES: A lot of long games becoming boring in short time as they have the same enemies over and over again. But that is not the case for this game. As you explore the wastleland, you will come across plenty of different enemies ranging from thugs and little creatures to heavily armored soldiers and super mutants. LOVED IT JUST LOVED IT.

DECENT STORY: While it is not the strongest aspect of the game, it does have decent story with somewhat of a suspense and oh depending on the choices you make, story and ending changes.

DIALOGUE TREE AND GOOD VOICE ACTING: If you played Mass Effect than you know what I am referring to. While talking to different characters, you can choose what you want to tell them. You can be charismatic and friendly or you can be rude. You choose. Again what you choose affects the end result of the game. To me what was nice was these dialogue were well designed and voice acting of hundreds of people you talk to was much better than what I expected. This truly makes gaming experience more rewarding.

(IF YOU HAVE GOTY)

FIVE DLCS = 10+ MORE HOURS OF GAMEPLAY: The five DLCs will add to the main story of the game, but in addition it will take to you to a hidden slave town, alient space ship, pre-nuclear explosion war era and on a mystic island. I loved all five of them especially the island and story+ dlcs.

INCREASE LEVEL CAP TO 30. If you don't have these dlcs, you can level up only to lv 20, but if you have these dlcs you can level up all the way up to lv 30. That means more traits, more choices and more unique powers.

******************CONS******************

GLITCHES: This is simply unacceptable. There are glitches in the game that can make you go crazy. For example for me I completed a mission and I didn't get achievement unlocked for that particular mission. Fortunately for 360 version a lot of these are fixed by patches. Nevertheless you will still encounter some.

LEVEL CAP: I also didn't like you can only level up 20 or 30 depending on which version you have. I wish they would at least let you level up to lv 50 and get all the traits possible.

****************CONCLUSION*****************

I truly wish they would have worked hard to fix the glitches, but contrary to those glitches this game has a lot to offer. 80+ hr of gameplay paid me back every single cent I spent to buy this game. I highly recommend this game to RPG and FPS lovers. If you can get GOTY (9.5/10), if not then at least give normal edition a shot (9/10).",5.0,B000UU3SVI,LONG LONG ENTERTAINING RPG,Video Games

"When we got Spyro's Adventure we all had our sights on Hex, she looks cool, has some neat looking moves and has a great personality and her voice actor suits her. Unfortunately that's all there is too her. I was the first to get her and I wanted so badly to like her but she has too many flaws. Pokmon players will understand when I say that she's like the Magikarp of the Skylander world, she's wimpy and a pain to level

Her defenses are what literally slay her, she has bad defenses, very weak, her bone fence will get taken out by tankier enemies easily and she dies quickly in a mob of anything but the weakest of enemies. If you decide to get her and play with her then get her hats and charms to ramp up her defenses or you will die a lot.

Her attack isn't much better, you have to power up her skull rain attack and while she's not the only Skylander who does this, she gets her attacks off slowly even with upgrades and there's a delay between when you push the attack button and when she launches her attack and it only takes an enemy bumping into you to disrupt it, her accuracy and critical hit is cruddy.

She's not a slow character when it comes to just moving around

Upgrades, hats and charms don't help her much and it's difficult to try to boost her stats in Cali's Challenges, Brock's Arena Challenges and I wouldn't recommend her in PvP mode.

I got rid of my Hex because I was just frustrated and disappointed and while the character mold looks good her arms are prone to ripping if your not careful. I had to have mine glued because her rubbery, thin arm got a tear in it.

 Trust me, there are better Skylanders to get for your money. If you want an Undead Skylander girl that can help you win the game, you'd be better off with Cynder or Roller Brawl.

All-in-all I'd recommend her for either:

"The classes that you can use are (excluding ""special"" classes such as Engineer or Holy Knight [one of my favorites]) Squire, Chemist, Knight, Archer, Priest, Wizard, Summoner, Ninja, Geomancer, Mediator, Mime, Calculator, Dancer, Samurai, Bard, Time Mage and Monk. If I didn't get them all, feel free to add! Remember, I only listed the MAIN classes, not the special ones.

The gameplay is a very strong point in the game. You fight monsters, humans or a mixture of both on a field of squares that you move from one to the next. It's somewhat time consuming going through the menus to battle, but really, if you're into strategy RPGs, you're used to this. I will mention one thing: I've found myself falling asleep to this game because the battles were slow. Not that this should detract you from buying this excellent game.

The story is seriously the strongest point in the game. You are in a huge place called Ivalice and you travel from town to town occasional going to waterfalls or swamps and what not. Ramza is the main character and he experiences betrayal, meeting new friends and fighting for what's right.

The sound isn't bad. The main music in battles against monsters (which can happen in between towns on the map) is OK, but you might get sick of it after a while. But some of it is pretty good. Not great, but good. Just don't expect it to blow you away.

I think I've touched on the main points. Once again, if I'm missing a class, feel free to tell me.

"If you ever wanted a gaming headset which has broader compatibility with most popular gaming consoles may it be a Xbox360, PS3, PS4 and all of your favorite mobile devices then look no further you now can enjoy your favorite game immerse yourself into virtual reality yet get connected to real life when needed! This is *NEW* and improved PX4 VERSION 2 (TBS-3276-011) which comes with 'PS4 Talkback' cable.

What's included? - 5 Stars!
The PX4 Premium wireless gaming headset comes with impressive array of essential accessories - So what's included? - The PX4 Headset, PX4 Wireless Transmitter, Detachable Boom Microphone, 'PS4 Talkback' cable, Xbox 360 Talkback Cable, Digital Optical Cable, Headset Charging Cable.

How does it work? - 4  stars!
The Ear Force PX4 is a premium, Dolby surround sound headset designed for PS3, PS4 and Xbox360 gaming plus works with your regular analog devices like MP3 players and Smartphones via Analog. The included `PX4 transmitter' processes Dolby Digital surround sound from your PS3, PS4 or Xbox360 and sends it to the headset via dedicated `digital RF'. The result is an immersive wireless sound environment that makes you feel as if you're right in the middle of the action. It also helps you react quicker during a gaming session by hearing exactly where the sound cues in the game are coming from. Unlike the regular `RF technology' used in most other wireless headsets, the dual-band Wi-Fi technology found in the PX4 can coexists with other wireless networks for optimum performance.

Apart from the Dual-Band the PX4 also incorporates Bluetooth technology which can be used to simultaneously pair to two Bluetooth-enabled devices at once. For example, you can pair the PX4 headset to your PS3 gaming console and your mobile phone at the same time. This allows you to use your headset to accept phone calls all while totally immersed in the action of the game. The Bluetooth connection only allows phone audio, Media audio profile is not available for Bluetooth connections.

How does it sound? - 4 stars!
The Ear Force PX4 is a good sounding headset for the price. While you cannot compare this with some high end headsets exclusively used for listening to music audio this is purely for gaming and yet remain connected with friends and family by enabling you to take incoming calls from your smartphone without getting off the gaming couch. There is a bit of hissing sound even when you keep the volume very low but not too distracting when the action begins. Incoming phone calls can be answered and the attached Microphone works well.

How good is battery life? - 5 stars!
The Ear Force PX4 also comes with a rechargeable lithium polymer battery that provides up to 15 hours of continuous game play on a single charge. The battery can also be recharged while gaming with the included long USB based charging cable so you'll never miss out on the action even when you are charging the Ear Force PX4.

How comfortable is it? - 3  stars!
Please bear in mind that this not too lightweight when compared to other basic headsets but the soft fabric cushions does help in minimizing the pressure on your ears for extended game-play. Most of these over the ear headphones do take few weeks to break-in and start feeling comfortable. I have had these only for few days but the initial impression was better than average. It does make clacking sounds when buttons are pressed since they are plastic. It does take some time to get used to the array of buttons and analog rotary controls.

Bottom-line: 4 stars!
The PX4 Premium wireless gaming headset comes with impressive array of essential accessories to hook up to most popular gaming consoles. Sounds good and works well to immerse you into the gaming environment. Total Wireless chat is available on PS3 gaming console only. Included talkback cables are required between headset and PS4 controller. Wireless chat on Xbox360 requires XBA adapter, which needs to be purchased separately. The inability to have `media profile' via Bluetooth for smartphones music playback combined with some minor cons mentioned above forced me to rate this with 4 respectable stars!",4.0,B00NHV0XV0,Broader compatible Gaming Headset!,Video Games

"They're alright, but the virtual 7.1 is completely useless. So, treat it as stereo only.

Also, the volume seems to be REALLY loud. Even turning the windows volume down to 1 out of 100 manually, and also changing the virtual speaker distance to make them further away, these things are still too loud!

Finally, the microphone is too soft. The boom can swing up and hide in the frame, which is cool, but when you swing it down to use it, you can't move it closer to your face. You'll have to speak pretty loudly to make sure people hear you for regular desktop applications. Gaming software like Mumble or Teamspeak or Discord, you will need to make sure to turn this up a good bit.

Also, I wish there were a way to change the lighting settings. The blue light on the outside of the ears constantly pulses, I wish there were a way to customize it. Like, maybe slow down the pulse rate, or make it constant on, or maybe turn it off completely for at night.

"Got this via Steam and love it. Son and I play with Xbox 360 controllers with no problem (on Windows 8.1). I think the game improves on some of 2s flaws (if you played the Marvel Lego Super Heroes, youll know some of these improvements). Basically, being able to move when people are changing characters is nice. Also, changing suits in this game is a hundred times better than in part 2. In the old game, free play got frustrating because suit changing stations didn't exist in every section. Worse, sometimes the electrical suit would lose its charge, requiring us to start over. Not an issue here.

There are bugs, as usual, and 2 crashes in the first 3 hours of playing. Not sure what to blame, but at least the game saves automatically and puts you back where you were when you restart (unlike in part 2 where you had to remember where you were exactly and you better hope the game doesnt autosave before you get there...)

This is a funny game and while the main story isn't very long, getting all the unlockables can be fun.

"The ""Terminator"" franchise doesn't need an introduction, but for clarity's sake, I'll give it one. Four films, all excellent in their own right, tell the story of a doomed Earth taken over by machines, and a group of rebels using time-travel to go back to the past and avert the mistakes which led to the chaotic apocalypse in which they live. With the exception of the most recent film, the series stars Arnold Schwarzenegger as a Terminator, a morally ambiguous death machine. Highlights of the franchise include large-scale futuristic wars, thrilling contemporary vehicle chases, and a surprisingly cerebral story arc. Ah, yes, and explosions. Lots and lots of beautiful explosions.

This sounds like it would make for a great line of video games, and many people have certainly tried to make some of the series. But the path to hell is paved with good intentions, and ""hell"" would be an apt word to describe most of the ""Terminator"" games. At best, horribly designed and offensively hackneyed, and at worst, buggy and incomplete, nobody has really captured the spirit of what makes the series so timeless. However, in 2004, one developer came close to actually getting it with ""Terminator 3: The Redemption.""

The plot retells the events of the T3 film, with a prequel and epilogue setting up the backstory of AH-NULD's iconic cybernetic deathbringer. It's... well, honestly, it's not that interesting. It plays out like a decent fan-fiction for the original parts, then like a Hit Clips version of the film when retelling T3's events. The new cutscenes are certainly cool to look at, and have some really great setpieces, but the story they tell is incredibly uninteresting. For hardcore fans like me, it's an interesting concept, but done pretty shoddily; for everybody else, it's probably just dull and uninspired.

What it lacks in substance, though, it makes up for in excitement. The gameplay is actually some of the best in a licensed game, and works pretty smoothly. You've got elements of a third-person shooter, brawler, and driving game rolled into one experience, which is exactly how a ""Terminator"" game should be. But not all of them work very well. The worst aspect, by far, are the brawler mechanics. Sluggish, repetitive, and needlessly elaborate (seriously, how many different ways do you expect me to mash the same two buttons?!), they seem like an afterthought. In the middle of the road, we have the shooting mechanics. They're pretty rudimentary and clumsy, but definitely functional; it's pretty satisfying to mow through opponents while dual-wielding assault rifles, after all, so it's forgivable if the combat itself is nothing special.

Where this game truly excels, though, are the driving sequences. Without fail, each one is incredibly exhilarating, and feature unique mechanics with each mission. It has one of the earliest usages of car-to-car hijacking (later seen in the ""Just Cause"" games), some great arcade-style controls that blend seamlessly with shooting, and a wide variety of backdrops in which chases take place. To top it off, some of the set pieces are simply some of the coolest I've experienced in a game. When's the last time you've jumped a pick-up truck off a cliff, then ziplined on a power line while holding the truck with your other arm across a valley? That, and more, occurs in this game. Honestly, if this game were nothing but driving, it would probably bump up my score a bit.

In the visual department, the game is a toss-up. The graphics are decent, and have a good amount of variety to them, especially in the driving portions. It's also cool to see Ahnuld deteriorate as he takes damage, which was a really nice touch. However, the futuristic portions of the game are really bland, and look like every other grey-and-black shooter out there. Also disappointing is the usage of footage from the movie when Ahnuld arrives in the present day, which just comes across as cheap and lazy.

And in the audio department, things just as mixed. Voice acting is pretty atrocious, in my opinion, even the halfway decent Ahnuld impersonator. Sound effects are weak and unsatisfying, offering no visceral punch for explosions and gunfights, which is sort of a hallmark of the franchise. The one redemption (ba-dum-tss) here is the soundtrack, which is exciting and provides some nice background noise for the on-screen action. I would even recommend muting the audio and just listening to the score; you wouldn't be missing much.

When all is said and done, I feel we're left with the best ""Terminator"" game available (that I've played, at least.) That being said, since virtually all of the other games are steaming piles, that's not really saying much. There are definitely some hints of brilliance in this game, but it needed a lot more development time before release; if it had been given that time, then we might have had one of the best actioners of the last generation. But as it stands now, ""Terminator 3: The Redemption"" is a fun little game that is wholly inoffensive, but definitely limited by technical issues that hold it back from true greatness.

"Wonderful installment of Mario Kart.
This game has come a long was since SNES days.

Plenty of new and old tracks (revamped).
All the same lovable characters.

New kart customization, new game modes, etc.

The great part of this game is that it utilizes ""Download & Play"" feature that not many others out there do.
Essentially, this means you can buy one copy and have 2 people (on separate 3DS/2DSXL) play it off the one cart.
The one that has it loaded opens apps, selects ""Download & Play"" and the other opens that app and enters that lobby to download the game and join the host (local network play only).

I thought they were making the game better (and the graphics and such appear stellar) but it now looks like they were just trying to force the online only platform during all the extra time and delays (I had it on order since 2010). I had hoped they would have learned from the Starcraft 2 debacle that people don't like the always on line games.  I travel a lot and don't always have an internet connection to play (like on long flights or in a building with no wireless reception and no wired connection)... they should have at least provided an option like Oblivion Skyrim (you need to be online to start the game... but then can be offline and your game needs to be saved locally until you play again online and the latest games can be synced with the Cloud).

"This is the same exact game that came out 18 months ago for the X-Box. To prove it, the game still uses WWF and not WWE. The roster was not updated, so its still the roster from late 2001. There is no story mode (Road to Wrestlemania), instead there are championship modes where you need to go through 12 wrestlers to get a title shot. The Raw arena is the ONLY arena and there are no backstage areas. Nor is there any real hardcore action, because even though there are 100s of weapons, these weapons are helmets, tables, jack-o-lanterns, chairs, bandanas and so on. The wrestlers do not bleed at all, not even with a code! There is a pretty deep create-a-wrestler feature, however you can only create 16 wrestlers even though this is a PC game! There is no RVD, Mysterio, Booker T and so on, however there is Rhyno, Spike, X-Pac, Credible and Haku. There are very few modes, exhibition and the king of the ring tournament. There are no table matches, ironman matches, or 6 man tag matches (even though the game lets 6 wrestlers in the ring at the same time). At least all of the titles are in the game that were in the WWF in 2001, Hardcore, Heavyweight, Light-Heavyweight, European, Women's, and Intercontinental. The play is very unbalanced, such as the Rock and the Undertaker can undoubtedly beat up K-Kwik and Taka, so there is no chance raising a new star! Another detail to the game is the new stamina bar, where your wrestler will get *winded* the more he runs and does power moves. So Rhyno cannot do gore after gore, because he would get tired. With there being a stamina bar, there is also a *voltage* bar, which is basically one long bar that determines who is winning and when you can do finishing maneuvers. The controls are unique, where you have an attack, grapple, block and action button. The attack button is capable of several attacks, such as hold up and press the attack button will do a dropkick, hold down and press the attack it will be a kick or a punch. It?s the same with the grapple button. The action button can do anything from perform a taunt, pin an opponent, pick up weapons, put on clothes and climb the turnbuckle.

"Dark Void is really a great game. Don't be fooled by the negative reviews. The combination of flight and ground fighting is revolutionized by allowing the user to decide what he or she wants to do right then. You want to soar into air to get a better position to pick off enemies? Go ahead. Sick of flying? Land. The gameplay is very enjoyable, a third person fps with some seriously fun missions. The best part of the game is that the levels don't feel like repeats. Each is new. During some, you'll have to infiltrate a futuristic building and blow reactor core, in others, you get to roam through the jungle scrounging for downed planes.
  Don't get me wrong. It's definitely not the best game I've ever played. It's more of a one-time-through game that never calls you back to play again. But yet it's still a boat load of fun the first time through.
  The graphics are good, the sound is great (this article is written in 2014), and the gameplay is awesome. The game lasts a solid ten hours, not much but not too little. The only thing that would make me double-guess this game is the story. Over-the-top melodramatic, angry, sad, frustrated, happy, ups and downs, utter predictability. The story is trash, and the last level of the game, an extremely easy flying boos battle, doesn't seem to fit into the game at all. It really just came out of nowhere.
  But it really didn't make any difference. As unsatisfactory as the plot and ending are, the pure delight at flying, running, jumping and blasting your way across the various maps is enough to make this a great game. Nowadays, it's getting pretty cheap used, so give it a try. It's an awesome game with a lot to love.",4.0,B0016NRS28,Fly or Stick to the Ground....The Choice is Yours.,Video Games

"I love the Spyro series. My favorite was Spyro Year of the Dragon which was perfect. When I heard Spyro was gonna be on next gen systems I was excited! Boy...I did not espect them to butcher the series for me. For one this game was not made by Insomniac games who are responsible for making the first 3 kickass games. That was my first sign this probably wasn't gonna be as good as I want it to be. (May contain spoilers)

Story: This entire story is a plot hole. In the 2nd Spyro Ripto was the main villian and you kill him at the end. This game gives no explanation on how the hell he returns. I understand the Dragonfly plot, but Riptos return is just crazy.

Graphics: Even though the graphics looked pretty good, I found lots of graphical glitches. For one the game lags alot. Before trading my copy I had a glitch where the all the sheep in the game front leg stretched into the sky. I restarted my console, but the glitch remained. It wouldn't go away. I also noticed the character designs seemed a little distorted at time. In the honey world theres a graphical glitch where all the honey stops flowing too. Damn! Did they have any quality assurance?

Gameplay: The gameplay works the same as the first 3 games, but new firebreathing techniques are added. I found lots of trouble wuth the bubble breath. I would be chasing a dragonfly and I will clearly be hitting it with the bubblebreath, but he won't be caught. That is a huge pain in the ass later on when you have to chase them annoying things on platforms and are faster. Once again theres lag. Lagging is a huge issue in this game because it happens often and slow gameplay. theres also this funny ass glitch where you swim un the air. In the homeworld just swim to the edge of the water at the Beach world entrance. Do a headslam and hold square when you do it and start swimming in the air like its water. You can go all over the place with it. This prooves they didn't test the game before releasing it. I also had trouble figuring out what to do after fighting Ripto. I got no ending or nothing, so I tried collecting everything. It was impossible. I needed one gem and it was in the Thieves den. I spent days looking for it even using Sparks to help, but it never showed up. In the dragon dojo there was a glitch that happens when you try to get the kites for the baby dragons. IIf you jump in the right spot around the kite trees, the game will make the mistake of thinking you touched the kite and give it to the baby. Removing any strategy involved with getting it the normal way.

Sound: One of the highlights of Spyro games was always the sound and music. The music wasn't too bad. Its definately not the usual Spyro formula, but it wasn't too bad. I notived alot of the music consisted of what sounds to me like Indian chants. My favorite tracks were in the Thieves Den level. The music is kind of boring though. Its lacks the intensity and fun of the older games. Sadly even the sound has glitches. sometimes the music and sounds skip. In the Dragon Dojo the sound of the enemies attacking skipped the entire time I was in the level and wouldn't go away until I left.

Lengh: This game is short. I MEAN short. Its only one world! I mean WTF! Spyro the dragon had 5 worlds including a bonus, Riptos Rage had 3 including an bonus, and Year of the dragon had 4 including many extras. This has one world with 7 or 8 short levels! From my knowledge theres not even a bonus for getting all coins and dragonflies. You don't get all your money from Moneybags the bear, theres no extra powers, nosatisfying cutscene, or any reason to try and complete the levels 100%. As mention earlier nothing happened when I defeated Ripto so I know this because of a LP I saw on Youtube.

 In short Spyro Enter the Dragonfly was a huge disappointment. This game could have been good if put in the right hands. I would love to see it remade with all these problems taken care of, but given the bad recession this series has had lately, I don't see that happening anytime soon.",1.0,B00006F2ZP,The glinchiest game I've ever played.,Video Games
"Me:  Not an ""avid gamer,"" which I consider anyone who spends hours and hours and hours playing games (not judging, just not me).  I've never played Fable before so I had zero expectations.  And I love Kinect (which apparently sets me apart from the majority of Xbox users).

I asked for this game for Christmas, and then put off playing it for a month because I was afraid it would be an epic saga that would take up all my time.  Yes and no; there are ample save spots (like every five minutes at least), so you can play for fifteen minutes or two hours, it's up to you.  I think that's fantastic since I never know how long I'll have to play or how quickly my attention will wander.  (And the story is engaging enough that you DO want to keep playing to see what the next challenge will be.)

Yes, it's on rails.  I can see where it might be better if you could roam freely (like Rise of Nightmares), but my problem with video games is I don't play enough of them that if I come up against a really difficult puzzle, I can only devote so much energy to solving it before I get bored and the game gets shoved to the back of the shelf, probably never to be played again.  This game guides you through and makes your goals fairly self-explanatory (probably way too easy for people who like puzzle solving).  This allows you to focus on the more enjoyable aspect of fighting with magic.

Magic.  It is SO MUCH FUN to blast your enemies with just your hands, hurling either energy balls or magic ropes to stun them or pull their shields away and then blast them.  The targeting isn't always terribly precise, but you can at least use both hands simultaneously, dispatching monsters left and right continuously (and if you keep missing, they eventually end up right in front of you where you can hit them very easily).  This goes a long way towards helping me forgive the on rails part, because I have enough to think about without worrying what my feet are doing too (although you can slide right and left to duck for cover or avoid missiles).  And I haven't died yet, even against ""bosses,"" which are not too easy or too hard (edit:  I died twice last night against mini-bosses, and sure enough, the save spot brought me immediately back to the beginning of the fight.  So no tedious re-covering of ground again).  This makes me think the game might be excellent for kids of a certain age who might not be ready for really hard monsters yet.

I'm also thankful you can sit while playing, because all the hurling I just described provides a really tough workout for the arms and shoulders, enough that I welcome the quiet interludes after battles of just steering the horse.

I don't know how far along I am, but I'm already sad about finishing the game and hoping the arcade option creates sufficient replayability (I'll update when I get to that point).

All in all I'm very pleasantly surprised by this game--especially at the super low price it's available for, this is absolutely worth trying out.  Maybe more people would like Kinect if they started with this one.

EDIT:  I finished the game last night, which astonished me; as I said above, I've never finished any games of this type before.  Which I felt a little proud of, except for the fact that the final ""boss"" is nothing of the sort (SPOILERS):  you basically fight off hordes of the same easy to kill creatures you've been fighting all along, while your companion Theresa handles the big bad.  I've never finished a game like this before, and even I think this was pretty lame.

As for replayability, I'm skeptical of this too.  I tried one level in arcade mode, and it was essentially just replaying that one short segment of the game.  I can't imagine this will hold my attention for long.

I'm glad I played it though.  Looking at it as a whole, I again think this would be excellent for younger kids who might be easily discouraged from more difficult games like this, as once you get the hang of the magic the play is pretty similar throughout.  There is also no nudity or gratuitous gore, which apparently is becoming harder to find in games.",3.0,B0050SY8UK,Much More Fun Than Expected,Video Games

They are already broken. The cord that goes into the left earphone and also has the little box on it where you can control volume and so on. Well, that cord if is shorting out. When it moves around naturally while playing games or doing anything on the computer it creates a static sound and the volume of what I am listening too goes low, if I shake the cord a little it fixes it, but then when I release it it messes up again. The cords own weight seems to cause this as you move around and pick up and let go of the cord when adjust volume or muting the mic.

The software has lots of features including a nice voice changer that is hilarious, but its also clunky and a pain when you want to do simple adjustments. The mic seems to be OK, but not great on this as well. Its removable, so maybe that causes some problems as its a plug in mic, not built into the unit.

ORIGINAL REVIEW from DAY 1-2-3 of use: So far they have great sound and a great mic as well. Comfort is also very nice. The software that comes with it is very good, allows you to change your voice for some fun and many other features to adjust the quality of the sound for gaming and music. Nice 7.1 surround features that actually work in games too. The ear cushions are thick and very soft and cover the whole ear nicely. Only have had them 1 week so not sure how long they will hold up, but much of it is made of steel/metal parts and feels top notch, I am very satisfied so far.

EDIT CONCLUSION:  I NO LONGER recommend this headset as the best bang for your buck. It does everything well at first. It seemed to have Beat all of my plantronics, razer, sades and other headsets by a longshot the first week or two as it worked fine, but the build quality, mic and software have me rating this very low. I paid $130 for this and it lasted about 35 days, that is terrible. My Sades for $29 lasted about 6 months before the plastic earcup gave out. I expected to have this set for a year or years to come, but now I am returning it and will not re-visit creative again for hardware such as this.",2.0,B013S3UY2E,"High quality sound, comfort, build and Mic, the best bang for your buck.",Video Games
"Here's the premise - you're this little guy with a net and a light sabre running around trying to capture these monkeys. The monkeys wear different colored pants, and have little sirens on their heads. The pants tell you how tough they are to catch, and the sirens tell you if they've caught on to the fact that you're trying to capture them.
In addition to the trusty tools I mentioned above, you get a whole slew of other gadgets you can use to capture the monkeys, including an r/c car, slingshot and monkey radar. Unfortunately, the monkeys are also armed with everything from grenades to machine guns to canons.
In addition to being hilarious (the commercials for the game were great, if you got a chance to seem them on TV), the joy of the game is using the analog controllers to move and manipulate gadgets.

"Before I bought the game, I was shocked to come on here and find that Civ V rated an average of 2.5 stars.  The game had been well reviewed by critics, was part of a long line of amazing games, and had supposedly made some great changes to the formula to start fresh with things like hex tiles and non-stacking units.  I had been excited about the game, but then almost considered not getting it.

Having broken down and purchased the game, and played it for a solid month now, I can tell you that a lot of the poor reviews are way off-base.  There was a lot of expectation for this game, because Civ IV had been such a masterpiece, and the initial release of this game was horribly buggy and imbalanced.  It has been regularly patched since then, however, and in fact was just patched on March 1st.  In it's current state, the game no longer crashes frequently (I have actually never experienced a single crash on my modest laptop, and I run that game at max settings), the in-between turn times are now minimal, and overall the game has been much more balanced to allow Domination, Cultural, or Scientific victories (Diplomatic victories are still kind of dumb... you may want to disable them).

So that negates a lot of the issues that people had with this game when giving it negative reviews.  Another that I have seen: Civ V can only be played online!  This is flat out not true.  You need to be online to download Steam if you don't have it, and then to download and install the game.  Then you can simply set Steam to work in offline mode and play the game regardless of if you have an internet connection.  Another gripe: you can't skip the opening cinematic!  Again, not true.  The cinematic masks a loading screen.  Hit space bar or escape as soon as you see the cinematic.  As soon as the game finishes loading, the cinematic will cut off and you'll reach the menu.

So I've spent a lot of time debunking the complaints.  How about things that are actually great about this game?  No more ""stacks of doom""!  That's right.  You or the AI cannot simply load 15 units into an unbeatable stack and destroy everything on the map!  Now that units don't stack, you need to be strategic in your placement of cavalry, archers, infantry, and artillery.  Combat in this game is the best of any Civ game, hands down.  Cities are no longer vulnerable for easy taking, but can defend themselves quite well from attack.  Units can attack from a range, or maneuver around the hex tiles for a tactical advantage.  You will no longer be told you have >99% chance of winning a battle, only to lose it.  A spearman will never beat a tank! (unless that tank is really REALLY wounded)

City management has also been streamlined quite a bit, I think for the better.  If you don't want to stress about which tiles get worked, which specialists are active, etc -- don't!  The game will smartly take care of this for you.  Or you can set your city to a specific focus (i.e. production, food, gold, or culture).  Or you can roll up your sleeves and micromanage everything it does.  The choice is up to you!  A lot of key Civ features like Science/Culture/Gold sliders are gone.  You need to actually put some thought into how you build your cities so that these issues can't be fixed with the flick of a mouse.  For better or worse, a lot of other familiar features like War Weariness, Health, Pollution, and Religion are gone.  Basically, this is an entirely new game, and it's unfair to compare it to Civ II or IV and hate it just because some of the features you like have been removed.

Have I mentioned that this game is absolutely beautiful?  Especially with a high end video card (which I sadly do not have, but my GF does), the leader animations are magnificent, the landscape is gorgeous, and the animations are detailed and realistic (try setting off a Nuclear Missile and see if your jaw doesn't hit the floor).  A ton of work went into the art design in this game, and even minor things like the circular picture for each technology or the mini icon for each military unit are well-thought out and unique.

A few criticisms, though, because honestly this game still needs a few patches and maybe an expansion to be perfect.  Diplomacy is simply not very good.  The AI is constantly hostile, and there is little you can do to improve relations. Diplomatic Victory is a case of buying enough votes to win the UN election (quite easy to do or have done to you).  Multiplayer is still a bit of a mess, with no LAN or hotseat support, and an extremely stripped-down game if you play over the internet.  But I have confidence that a lot of these problems will be fixed by Firaxis and 2k games, as they have already done a superb job of addressing the Civ community's complaints, and improving their product on a steady basis.  And oh yeah: tired of the civs you can play with?  Shell out a few extra bucks for extra downloadable civs and scenarios.  Polynesia releases tomorrow.

I'm not writing this to attack the 1 and 2 star reviewers... everyone is entitled to their opinion.  I just want everyone to give this game a fair chance, because it really is something special, and has the potential to be the greatest Civ game in the series.  Personally, I'm in no rush for Civ 6... I want to enjoy this game while it's still fresh and exciting.  Once you start playing, it's impossible not to get sucked into the familiar ""One More Turn!"" addiction.

I'm back again with another Xbox game review. If you don't know what game to pick. You stay in the store all day trying to pick out a good game. I'ts okay. If you have a party for Xbox and you think all of the games are boring (except Halo) which they're not of course then wait no more. NFL Fever 2002 is the game to pick. You cna choose from 31 teams including bonus teams and stadiums and the dynasty mode is the best. As you progress through the season or seasons you will notice under Trophy case that there is a Hall of Fame and Retired Jerseys and other things you will see the team that won the previous season. Does Madden do that? No way. I'm on 2012 with my favorite team the Carolina Panthers. I've won 1 Super Bowl. Broken many rushing records with Willie Green from BC. He really is.

this is an objectionable review.  The graphics are awesome,

the gameplay and cut scenes are smooth, but you can't skip them.

The level design's pretty good, and can seem expansive at times.

There's brutal violence, and I was like ""Oh H**L no, he didn't.""

with combat, bossfights, and some elemental puzzles,

but I fought through it because I wanted to what would happen next.

The last two weapons you get are bi**hin'.

One of the puzzles forced me to go online for a solution.

The gameplay's pretty gratifying.  The controls are pretty complex,

mostly due to combat; there's alot to think about, equipping stuff you

get from those you slay.  I didn't play it all the way through,

because SPOILER ALERT I didn't have the desire to beat Zeus around

From this point, this mini-squad must take on missions in reaction to the events that play out in the story.

Over the first few areas, you're only in control of the standard trooper, Templar, but as you pick up more allies, you'll get your choice of team member at the beginning of each mission. The four team members play differently and have various bonuses and detriments. Luger has heat vision, Hakha can sneak up on Helghast, while Rico is the all around heavy gunner who can take additional punishment. The action in Killzone is broken up into levels, which are further separated into sublevels. While each level features the occasional checkpoint, players can only save at the end of each stage. Rather than a seamless gameworld, Killzone's stages are broken up by lengthy load screens.

The core gameplay of Killzone is your standard FPS fare, though you will find more of the game will be spent fighting behind cover to minimize your damage. A lot of running from cover to cover should be expected. To this effect, you have a sprint button that will lower your weapon and allow you to run a short distance. You'll have primary and secondary fire (on most weapons) and even grenades to your disposal. If you get in close, you can perform a melee attack to disarm and take out your opponent.

While there is no ability to jump, you will find the occasional barrier that you can leap over. Along your path, you'll often find gun and cannon emplacements. With the tap of a button, you can use that firepower to your own. But, considering the legions of Helghast that come after you, the most heavy ammo you can drop, the better.

While Killzone does feature a variety of weapons, there is some imbalance in terms of stopping power. With only three weapons a player can have on hand, it won't take long for players to figure out what they should keep on hand. The assault rifle is pretty solid, but never has enough ammo. On the other hand, the Helghast assault rifle takes way too many bullets to drop an enemy. The shotgun has a long reload time, which almost negates it's usefulness. Of course, there's heavy ordinance to be found and abused, including grenade launchers and a rocket launcher.

Along with the main story are both online and standard multiplayer modes. Both provide extra enjoyment, but are dependent on the quality of your opponents. Fortunately, there's more of an arcade-like element to the multiplayer, allows for faster, more furious gunbattles. Of course, you can always try to play it more like the story missions, but with so many good weapons being spawned, why bother?

Visually, Killzone has a wonderful art direction that works to deliver a solid and believable gameworld. The Helghast are successfully presented as an intimidating Nazi/Jin-Roh hybrid that the player must push on through. The game world does a fine job at setting up real world locations, whether they be war ravaged streets, a park, a swamp or soldier-infested docks. Levels are laid out in such a way that most of the scenarios provide both challenge and a certain level of intensity. From a technical standpoint, though, Killzone is pushing the PS2 for all it can get and still could use more power. While there is a lot of minor details, the limited color palette and repetitive and low-res textures wash out many locations and even leave some areas feeling quite repetitive. You'll also find a serious lack of enemy variety will leave you feeling like you're killing the same foes over and over again. I have to wonder if Killzone was on a brawnier unit, would the levels have more visual detail and larger? Would there be more enemy types and would the draw distance be longer?

The audio portion proves to be a solid augment to the visual portion. Music is nicely done and works with the futuristic military theme of the story. Sound effects have a good bit of variety and range, especially in the gun sounds and explosions. In the story sequences, the voice cast (including Kal Webber, Tom Clarke Hill and Brian Cox) does a good job with the script they're given. During gameplay, though, their comments are limited and can get old pretty fast. Even worse is that the Helghast have even fewer comments, so killing them by the score isn't made better by the the repetitious comments.

Is Killzone a bad game? Not really. There is certainly a good time to be had here, but it really depends on what you have available to you. If you have access to a PC or Xbox, Killzone pales in comparison to other titles already available. If all you have is a PS2, then Killzone is likely one of the best games the genre will offer you right now. With a little more power for the engine and more refinement, this could have been a great game, but there is still a good time to be had here.",4.0,B00020LZAW,"Pushes the PS2 to the limit, NOT a Halo killer though",Video Games

"We got this game in the German version (it's a European produced game.) It's a huge hit in Germany, where there are contests for figuring out puzzles in game scenarios.
This is a sort of Civilization set in the olden times, 1602 of course, when galleons discovered new worlds and set out to create trade routes and garner wealth for aristocratic settlers. The game starts by settling an island (you are in a race with the computer, who tries to beat you to a choice bit of land. Some of the islands are lousy--too many volcanoes, for one thing, or lacking essential resources.)
You need to build up from wood-cutting plantations, to cotton and grain, up to the ability to mine, forge metals and eventually build some handy cannons and muskets to take out the pesky pirates. Did I mention pirates? Well, as you are shipping from island to island, running your important trade routes, these nasty guys pop up and take your stuff, not to mention try to sink your ship. Eventually, it's payback time and you'll deal with them.
Meanwhile, it's all you can do to keep the locals happy (tip; don't forget to build a hospital. It's demoralizing to see a once-happy island decimated by the Plague.) Then the locals want more, more, more. Schools, churches, universities, even a palace and cathedral. And they like their booze and tabaccy, not to mention regular meals. If you starve the people, they won't forgive you. And you can lose.
This game has nice graphics, and is pleasing as either a single-player or multi-player game. It appeals to women as well as men because the military aspects are secondary to building and developing a new land. The only criticism is that the military function is boring. You clear your enemy islands the same way every game and it gets old. The play is straightforward and with a minimum of help from the manual, it's easy to get engrossed in game right away. You can adjust the speed to single for detail work or jump up to double speed for the boring bits. There are demos available online to download, including the new 1503 A.D., a new game, which has more complicated graphics, and enhanced ""everything"" --something to work up to when you get bored with 1602. 1602 AD is one of our favorite games of all times.",4.0,B00004KHDN,"A great single player game, can be multi-player as well",Video Games

"Look, I've been playing this game nonstop.  It's very fun but sometimes the game is just stupid.

First we will start with player movement.  Often times your player is very sluggish and slow.  Changing directions is nonexistent and the player always makes this slow turn around that frustrates to no end (if you've played the game you know what I'm talking about).  The defense is horrendous.  If you hold an opposing point guard under 20 points consider yourself an expert and if you can stop Pau Gasol from shooting 90% from the post then you have serious skills.  The post defense is simply terrible when playing against the computer.  For example you may be playing against Varejao and he's out there making it seem like he's Kareem Abdul Jabbar instead of being self-guard like he is real life.  He has no offensive post talent.  It's not conceivable to have good post defense unless Dwight Howard is on your team.

Speaking of post defense, it's nearly impossible to stay in front the opposing teams point guard.  ANY point guard.  And even with help defense turned up, your center or power forward will refuse to contest the shot.  It's ridiculous.  Then when you switch manually they switch to some small forward that has no chance to block or contest the shot leaving it open for a wide open uncontested layup by some random point guard.

Another thing that has plagued the series for a minute is the transition offense.  I'm so sick and tired of having 3 on 1 breakaway easy layups/dunks turn into an absolute nightmare.  The first obvious is WHY do the two leading the break run to the three point line??!?!?!?!??  Possibly the first drill of basketball that you learn in pee wee is the three man weave.  Nowhere in that drill is the three point line.  So why in an NBA game, where the professionals play, does Vince Carter, LeBron James, Paul Pierce run to the three point line and stop?  Completely frustrating.

Also pertaining to transition offense is the outlet pass.  The offense has crashed the boards, your three man has outletted for the fast break.  Your center throws him the ball on the outlet.  Sounds good so far except that it takes your player approximately 1.5 seconds to figure out how to catch the ball and keep running at the same time.  That's right they catch the ball with this slow motion, slow enough to allow the defense to get back in front of them and prevent the fast break.  Terrible.

So with limited success on the fast break, you are forced to slow it down and get some work in the post game.  That's not a bad idea.  So somehow we get a mismatch in the post.  Somebody switched off and it's now Chris Bosh versus some random point guard on the block.  Chris Bosh receives the ball on the post and is somehow magically not able to back down this 195 lb 6'2 point guard.  Somehow this guard has held the fort steady forcing you into some fadeaway or highly contested shot.  Unrealistic.  Not to mention the absolute worst entry passing ever in video games.  Instead of delivering a real pass like a man, they will throw this weak rainbow lob that almost always gets tipped either by the passer's man or the defender coming around the post.  This is unacceptable.

Another flaw is the abundance of alley oops by non jumpers and non passers.  I mean really is the Louis Williams to Elton Brand alley oop really a threat????  Or the Jason Williams to Brandon Bass???  Stop with the nonsense 2K!  And your team acts like the can't recognize it and jump to block the ball.  And when you switch and hit the triangle to jump they jump 1 ft off the ground not even trying.

One of the series staples is the infamous missed dunks and layups.  No need to elaborate here...just know that it has returned.  Free Throw shooting is always an issue because sometimes the game gives you this angle where you can't correctly judge when to let go resulting in missed layups.  It's just hard to stay consistent shooting free throws.

Dribbling is not fun at all.  The crossover is a chore and very ineffective and some PROFESSIONAL SG & SF's can't even crossover on the game which is completely ridiculous.  More often than not there will be plenty of pick and rolls.

In Association mode, developing a player is nearly impossible especially a rookie.  The shooting drill is just plain stupid.  The point total to achieve is ridiculously high and not only that players must now get their own rebound which is unfathomable.  So if you are trying to improve your power forward's mid range game the correct way (instead of just editing the player) you can forget it because he's more often than not too slow to finish in time and not a good enough shooter to knock down all the chances you do get.  Not to mention the sluggish player movement already discussed.  The other drills are just as useless and needless to say real player progression is a joke.

Enough of my ranting though because the game is seriously fun and addictive and I play it everyday and online.  Just be prepared for the many flaws apparent.",4.0,B002C7RBFQ,NBA 2K10 has plenty of flaws,Video Games
"Awsome game specially if you are into squat-based tactical shooter games, or even if you dont, I can assure you will have quite a good time playing through the game`s main campaign. I haven't played online yet cause I care more about the main campaign, however after I finish it I will connect to xbox live. I have been able to peek at the multiplayer maps and it seemengly runs smoother than the main campaign, like a better frame rate kind of thing. The  graphics of this game are pretty good with very life like enviroments and an exellent recreation of Mexico City. It takes about an hour to get used to the HUD to issue orders to your ghost squat and other gadgets the game offers, but once You feel comfortable with the control scheme you will have such an enjoyable experience. The computer controlled AI, though has to be tewaked quite a bit for near comming games of the series specially for the ghost squat. This game really turned out to be a great game and it shouldnt eventually disappoint anyone. Despite the graphics are trully next gen and realistic when compared to the latest graphical  achievements such as CO4 and uncharted, you would pretty much say that they still can be improved.

"After so many Marvel games out there finally a decent looking game featuring DC's most popular heroes. For those of us who grew up reading DC comics this game is a dream come true.

The pros:

Wonderful realistic graphics that can rival the PS3.

Outstanding cinematics where you see all the characters up close, thus provide the storyline of why you're saving the world with your heroes team. Great voice acting.

Great combat system and use of all the superpowers of each hero. Also the change of costumes from the classic ones to recent new looks for certain main characters.

Ability to play with a friend and switch characters. Play in various modes; easy, medium, hard, elite and superhero. Though aimed mostly at a male audience, female players can play as Huntress, Hawkgirl, Zatanna and of course Wonder Woman.

Once finished you can open the extended play feture and have all your experience and new costumes and superpowers upgrades transfered to a new game mode of your choice.

Unlock other heroes as game goes on.

The cons:

Gets a little repetive after a while.

No mini-games.

Details on the costumes of some characters have been omited.

Only certain heroes can and must be used in certain levels.

Overall is quite entertaining and finally get to see DC most beloved superheroes in realistic 3D form. The controls aren't that tricky to use unlike previous games that featured Batman. I think a sequel should follow.

Special notes:

If you stop playing for a minute and a half without pausing, your heroes will say 3 different funny phrases about themselves or you as the player. All heroes have them.

"Mark Ecko's Getting Up: Contents Under Pressure (Atari/PS2) attempts to bring to life one of Hip-Hop's most known and practiced elements. The art of tagging can be found from the streets of New York City to the farms of Iowa to the hills of Europe and Getting Up attempts to bring that to life. The game gives users the opportunity to travel around a fictitious city (similar to NYC) tagging surfaces, and fighting cats, meanwhile building a rep in the process. There are very few, if any, games with a similar premise and Atari definitely has taken ""cyber tagging"" to a new level with this game.

The story revolves around Trane, a young urban misfit who hopes to get a rep by tagging over rival crews pieces and whatever surface he can get his paint on. He lives in the oppressive futuristic city of New Radius and is ambitious about becoming a star graf artist, but there are a ton of obstacles to contend with. Rival tagging crews and fascist-like police officers called the Civil Conduct Keepers (CCK) are very much interested in stopping Trane and destroying his art. These obstacles are just miniscule parts of missions given for Trane to complete however. While fighting is important, the game is clearly centered on tagging. Each mission will have Trane completing a set number of graffiti-related objectives. The actual play mechanic for laying down your tags is easily picked up and you'll add new ways to apply tags as the game progresses. However, tagging anywhere just simply isn't an option. Even if you want to tag certain areas that look like they'd be perfect locations, the game will not allow you to do it. You'll be guided in your tagging quests by your intuition. In Trane's case, his intuition shows him the way to a sweet spot for putting up his tag.

As previously mentioned, obstacles such as the rival graffiti gangs and the CCK brings us to one of the most important game aspects into play: combat. Here you use punches, kicks and even some impromptu weapons such as paint cans, poles and the like. The combat system is not exactly on the level of say, Mortal Kombat, but it does have and punch combos, grabs, and power moves. The issue is that it seems like a lot of button mashing and senseless fighting. Also, the combat controls just aren't responsive enough to make the fighting really enjoyable. In fact it is almost reminiscent of old Nintendo controls, A, B, A, B.

On a positive note, Getting Up features a very difficult to rival soundtrack, story line and dialogue to accompany game play. However, while all of Getting Up's diverse elements come together as a moderately entertaining experience; it really could have used a bit more polish before it hit store shelves. If you are in to the graf culture then this is the game for you. However, if you're looking for an epic game that requires actual skill, then Getting Up is for toys.",3.0,B0008JILU4,Marc Ecko's Getting Up: Contents Under Pressure,Video Games

"I have read a lot of reviews on this game and some are good and some are bad.  I have had the game sense day 1 and I am overall pleased.  No its not the exact same as BF2 but who thought it would be?...It does have many simularities.

PROS:
-Graphics and Game effects are amazing.  This is the only game that I played where Multiplayer has the same effects and graphics as single player.  Its like playing a new Single player level every game I get into.  If that makes any sense.

-Single player was I thought, very good.  Seeing that they never had a story mode before.  I found myself actually following the story which hardly ever happens.

-Movements in the game are very good.....

-The weapons and weapons upgrades are very nice and well setup.  The TAC light is amazing to blind your opponent and the Laser light is good to let them know they are about to get shot but still blinding them a little. Thank God BF3 does not do kill streak rewards like MW games.

-Maps are huge and I read a review saying that you can only go certain places and the maps were smaller than BF2....I will have to disagree.  There is no borders on the map like there were on BF2 that I have seen.....but the maps seem huge and I don't find myself being corridored in where I need to go.

-I do like the fact that they narrowed down the classes you can pick from and also each class can only carry one grenade..that is a plus...there was nothing worse than starting out a I/O map at Strike at Karkand with nothing but an all out grenade war for 10 minutes...and with the Ammo guys giving packs to everyone it never stopped...now you can still get more grenades but it happens a lot slower now and you only reload one at a time.

-Strategery...although you do not have the Commander which does suck but I still feel it is very strategic and not like a run and gun as the MW games.  You can't just get in a Map on BF3 and if you are really good your probably not going to carry your team like in the MW games.  Its a group effort.  I also noticed there is no squad speak which also sucks but thinking about it now most people as myself like using 3rd party programs to talk to your fellow peeps...but I know if you are just playing by yourself and want to tell the random person on your team to get out of a doorway then that doesn't happen...but 9 times out of 10 they wouldn't listen to you anywway.

-The game as a whole I am pretty pleased with.  I was a HC BF2 fan and although its has lots of differences I am still a fan.  Sure beats the MW games in my opinion.

-I do like the fact if you can't take the enemies home base it will make it to where you are not even aloud in there.  It will give you a out of the combat zone warning.  I think this is good in the fact that there won't be massive spawn raping when you are getting hammered by the other team.

CONS

-The game is launched with a we broweser which I think is retarted.  I agree with a lot of the reviews about this issue, and they pretty much sumed it up.

-Random disconnects, I have not has as many as other people have stated and it will be a little while before some fixes come out.  But I have had about 4 random disconnects sense I have been playing at day 1.

-Haven't heard this mentioned yet but I was in a chat party with a friend of mine and he joined a map with the party and it loaded him in the server but mine loaded the single player...this has happened to me 5 times which I think is a little much but it has only happened to my friend once.

-I think some maps need a little bit more vehicles such as jeeps or buggies because there is not enough if you are getting pounded on a map.

-THE SPAWNS....I can't count the amount of times that I will be in a building or hidden somewhere reloading and someone spawns right behind me....it happens way to often....and I have even spawned a lot of times and there is some enemy standing right in front me and of course I light him up but you would think it would be an easy fix....I know that this problem will always happen but it could be dogged down a little bit.

-CHAT WINDOW...Wow could it be any bigger....It takes up like a third of the screen its kind of ridiculous..who thought that was a good idea?  It is slightly see through but not much and its light blue.  Just a Terrible idea

Overall like I said I really like the game...it does have its bugs but every game does......give it some time if you are worried about it.  I will update if I think of anything else.  The main problem I see is with Origin and how the game launches...but the game is very enjoyable.  Thanks for reading.

UPDATE 5 DEC 2011

I have put just a little over 100 hours in on this game and I am more pleased with it then when I started.

GAME LAUNCHING UPDATE-

It looks like they fixed most of the bugs with the HUGE Nov 22nd update with the launching of the game.  I know some poeple had a lot more problems then others.  But this is what it fixed for me.

-My game has not loaded Single player when I try to join a multiplayer server sense the update in Nov.
-A lot less hangs

Some things that still need to be fixed....

*Sometimes when I join a friend in a party and it asks me if I want to join voice at the top right hand corner of the chat box...I click it...and it says I have joined voice chat but it never really joins..then you click on it again and it tells you, you are already in voice chat...The only fix I have seen for this is to exit out of the party and create another one then invite your friend or have your friend do it.  Kind of annoying and I know programs mess up from time to time but this happens way to often.

*90 percent of the time when I first bring up Battlelog and join my first map for a play session I get an error of Battlefield 3 stopped working.  All I have to do is go to that same server again and rejoin but thats not the worst part.  Here is the problem I ran into and it was very frustrating at first.  Let me explain....

---When I click on that first server the window in the bottom left comes up on battlelog saying that your connecting, then joining, then loading level.  This will stick on the loading screen if BF3 has stopped working, BUT the error window that pops up will not POP up OVER the battlelog window so you don't even know you got an error.  So there I am looking at the window that says loading for like 5 minutes and wondering why it is taking so long.  So then I click close game so I can load a new map, and then I close battelog to restart it and then I see the little BF3 stopped working window.  So from now on this is what I do....I play BF3 on Windows 7.  I have pinned a BF3 shortcut to my task bar.  Now when I click on a server and when BF3 starts to load I can see the clear box around my BF3 pinned shortcut on my taskbar and I click it.  This will either bring me to a in game loading screen with the Map in the background which then I know it is working correctly or it brings up that little window to let you know BF3 has stopped working.  I have had to tell many people this that I play with..and it has saved lots of time.

GAMEPLAY

They tweaked a lot of weapons in a good way with the big patch in November but here are my opinions....

*PLEASE oh PLEASE Get rid of Motars...Motars totally ruin all the close quarter City Maps.  All it is, is MORTAR after MORTAR.  The only time I use a motar is to kill another mortar guy.  Yes I can keep the motar guys busy by motaring them but I don't want to sit there and motar an entire round because it is EXTREMELY boring...People SPAM the MOTAR tubes way to much.  If you don't get rid of them please just do something about them.  Limit them in many ways.  I found myself and all my friends just basically playing the larger maps because 95 percent of the time its MORTAR spamming in all the other ones.

*One more thing to get rid of....the IR scope for all weapons...this thing is ridiculous.  Anything and everything that alive lights up BRIGHT ORANGE.  I think half the fun is finding the people in the map because the graphics are amazing and there are lots of spots to hide.  Everyone one uses this scope and who wouldn't...I do for the simple fact that I know 98 pecent of all users use it..so they can see my Bright Orange Butt coming from a mile away.  So I want the same advantage as they do.  If you get killed by a person in BF3 9 times out of 10 they have and IR scope and if they don't have one thats just becuase they haven't unlocked it yet or their pride keeps them from using it.

PLEASE IF THEY JUST REMOVED THOSE 2 THINGS BF3 WOULD BE SO MUCH BETTER.

-HACKERS-

Seeing lots more hackers everytime I play.  Most of these are usually Aim Bots.  You will have this with any FPS.  But this is why ALL PC games(...you hear that ACTIVISION and IW.....)ALL PC games should have dedicated servers like BF3 does so the Admin can kick them.  But not all servers have admins in there at all times so to report someone as a hacker to EA, well I had to google it but here it is...

Go to the persons homepage on Battlelog and towards the top right hand corner of the screen just under the tabs, and to the right of the persons pic and name there is a little circle with a triangle in it.  If you hit this a window will pop up and say report abuse.

I do not know how EA handles there hackers yet but I hope they do.  Well all know that Steam really doesn't anything about it.  So I am curious if EA takes a different approach.  PLEASE EA DO SOMETHING!!!!!!

SUMMARY

All and all this is a very fun game, and I will continue to enjoy it.  I am a huge COD and BF fan and I personally love them both.  I have not purchased MW3 yet becuase 1 first person shooter is enough and I waited 5-6 years for the sequel to BF2.  Now I have it...at the rate COD is going by the time I get done playing BF3 they should be on MW6 by then and then I will buy it.  Thank you for reading and if you have any questions let me know.

-------UPDATE 20 June 2012---------

So after having this game for a while I wanted to update my review and knock off a couple stars because of lots of reasons. Here is the first!!!

CONS

PREMIUM- So premium came out recently and it is $50.  It comes with Back to Karkand and and believe 3 other map packs each with 4 new maps and guns plus you get to play the maps 2 weeks before anyone else being a premium player.  Also you get this tag that says premium that pops up on your opponents screen when you kill them.  Nice marketing.  This is why I do not like premium.......They get to jump ahead of you in queue when you are waiting to get into a server.  i was really excited when EA set up server queues but I did not know this was the beginning of charging extra so you can jump ahead...so now I find myself getting kicked up in queue when I am trying to join my favorite servers.  Thanks EA.

So say you already bought BF3 with the Strike to Karkand expansion.  Well it comes with premium also, so basically you will just be purchasing it again to become a premium player.  Seriously EA, is it that hard to do a 10% discount or have 2 premium bundles, one with B2K and one without?....SERIOUSLY.

Ok enough about premium now on to some game play.

-TANKS-

The thermal on the tanks is RIDICULOUS....you can see across the map and everything that is alive lights up bright white.  PLEASE FIX!!!  When the game first released the thermal scope for all the rifles could see just as far and they dumbed it down so now  you can only see about 30 meters or so.  Now you have tanks shooting you from 500-600-700 plus meters from there base...its ridiculous.  PLEASE FIX IT.

Another thing I have not gotten down with the tanks is the damage on them.  I will be in a tank and get hit by another tank and one shot will disable me, or one RPG will disable me and it hasn't just happened once.  It happens every time.  Doesn't not matter if I have reactive armor or what but its stupid.  I have 240 hours logged on this game and I still haven't figured it out.  I have hit tanks before with 4 T-90 tank rounds and not even disabled them but when they shoot me once I am disable.  I just don't get it.

CO-OP

I still have not been able to play co-op and neither has any of my friends that play...I know it works...I have seen many many people online with the weapons you have to unlock with co-op.  It crashes every time.

HACKERS

More and more hackers every time I get on.  I mean ridiculous hacking like killing me with a P90 while I am in a tank or using the paddles and killing me while I am flying in a jet.

MORE UPDATES

Instead of coming out with more stuff lets crack down on some stuff that is wrong with the game and make it better.

OVERALL

Its a good game but having the premium players bump me in server queues, and killing me with weapons from another map pack that I don't have in an original map I think its ridiculous.  I think its great if they are a premium player that is their choice but it shouldn't effect my game play that I gave $60 to play.  So if you pay the $50 you are better than every one else that just has the normal game. Its almost like when these companies sell a game now it's like you only get 30% of it and then you just keep paying and paying for the rest of it until the next one comes out. I guess this is what gaming on PC is coming too.  Its just pretty much turning into console online play and that is no good.  I have been a huge BF fan heck BF2 got me into online gaming and I still love that game.  Thanks EA for not caring about your original customers.

"OK, I know on all platforms they sold over 7 million copies, 12% was PC. It looks like they put forth 12% of effort to port this marvel from console. Come on! No advanced graphics options, is this PC or what? No lean? Can't kick hackers? Host migrating? No actual ping displayed? No mods? No dedicated servers? Most weapons sound like silenced variants. Almost no recoil.

But I bet we will get plenty of DLC.

Some SP mission are fun, including UAVs, I'll give you that. Scripted to hell, but it is still fun. Graphics is very crisp. Problem is it's about 4-5 hours long. Good movie these days is about $10 for 2hr+ flick. So about $5/hr of entertainment. With CODMW2 you shell out $60 for 4hr, thus paying $15/hr.

It is a sad fact that game development of major A title costs upward of $40 million. Mainstream gaming has been heading console direction for a while. There are many reasons for that. This is very good example of the trend.

EDIT: More thoughts on SP gameplay... (I didn't even bother to spend a lot of time in MP.) Since MW2 took after World at War, it is very irritating when game switches between characters all the time. Quickly you lose track of who is who. Plot is impossible to figure out. I wished MW1 continued... May be I'm getting old but in order to enjoy hectic combat you really need to be a 14 y/o high on red bull with strobe lights flashing and techno blasting at the same time. Half of the time your screen will be splattered in red with ""RELOADING"" blinking... No matter where you turn, there are always at least four new enemies pop up like jack in the box at your 12, 3, 6 and 9 o'clock and you never have time to reload. This game tries to be serious and Serious Sam at the same time. Jeebus Chroist, pick your poison and stick to it, Infinity Ward! I really enjoyed MW1, combat was tense where needed, not non-stop glow stick fest at the Annual Big Rave. And yes, you will miss no-lean in about 2 minutes into the game. And yes, AI can lean and use cover to fire...

On a positive note: Game runs very smoothly maxed out and what features that still remained in the game were pretty well polished. Voice acting, motion capture, models, explosions are superb. I'm running it on Windows 7 64bit, E8400, 4G of RAM, HD 4890 and 2 Intel X-25m in RAID-0. Not totally surprised since there is almost no draw distance (try Arma2 for a change ;-) Also I liked smartly designed level loading, while you watch pretty meaningless movie, game will be loading in the background.",3.0,B00269QLJ2,PC gaming is dying,Video Games
"This game is one of the best on the market.  It has brought hours of enjoyment for my son and his friends ( and me!).
The graphics are great and the game play is very smooth.  There are lots of options that make game play interesting ... plus 20 or so characters to play with.
Pausing the game during a battle captures some great action shots.

"I just finished this game last night, and I can honestly say that it is one of the best games I've played in the past year. You can tell the developers really put time into making a really special game. Here's my review:

Story

Listen, I'm not much of a fan of storylines in videogames, but having said that, I do recognize when a game has a great storyline (Drake's Fortune) and a terrible one (Resident Evil 5). The story of Darksiders is forgettable and confusing. I found myself skipping most cut scenes. This is easily the weakest part of the game.

Gameplay

This is where Darksiders shines. The gameplay is really, really fun. As people have mentioned it is a combination of God of War and Zelda, but in no way is it a copy of these games. It's definitely it's own, unique game for sure.

You get plenty of weapons and magic, and upgrades to both throughout the adventure, which by the way, will take you 20-25 hours to complete. As the game progresses the puzzles become much more difficult and new things are added, such as the glaive and portal gun. Simply put, this game has a terrific balance of combat, platforming and puzzle solving. I found myself looking forward to playing it every day and making progress.

Graphics

The graphics are great, a little on the cartoon-ie side, but still very sharp. Combos look and feel great and the level design is really unique. As I mentioned earlier, the developers really did a great job creating this open world.

Enjoyment

I enjoyed this game a lot. If you are into games like God of War and Zelda, this is a perfect fit for you. My only complaint is the puzzles become too difficult the last 3rd of the game, kind of ruining the great pace by having to stop and look at walkthroughs to figure out what you're doing. Small complaint...bottom line...this game is 100% worth a purchase. It is a game that I will not soon forget and really was a great experience.",4.0,B001D7T2VC,Darksiders is Worth Every Penny!,Video Games
"I was part of the beta for this game and among the hoards who vowed that that they would never submit to this insane pricing plan.  Well, it's less than a month since the beta ended, and here I am meekly licking Wizards of the Coast's boots.  It's sad, really.  Unfortunately, this really does combine everything that made Magic: the Gathering addictive in the first place with the additional conveniences of always being able to find a player and of having the computer act as an automatic rules interpreter.
I will note that the interface could stand a certain amount of improvement.  There's absolutely no scroll button support, even for such simple tasks as scrolling through menus, and some of the right click options are less than intuitive.  They could also benefit from such features as a way to print your card lists out, an easier way to find open tables (yes, I am familiar with all of the ways to do so -- they're all substandard), and other minor things that I hope will eventually get patched.  Overall, though, the interface is well done and do an admirable job of capturing the play and feel of the original game.
But the pricing scheme is still miserable.  Do not buy this product!  Do not demo it!  Stay far away and don't let it hook you.  Pity those of us that it has.",4.0,B000069LH9,"Greedy company, but I'm still playing",Video Games

"COD-WAW - the latest installment of the Call Of Duty series is set in the closing stages of WWII. As with most COD games, you alternate between two characters. In this case a Russian advancing on Berlin, and an American GI clearing out the Japanese islands.

Controls
As you'd expect, COD-WAW is a first-person run-and-gun game. You can sneak (and on some maps you have to) but for the most part it's shoot or be shot at. The controls are pretty good for this. Left stick moves you, right stick adjusts where you're looking. Various buttons crouch, jump, reload and fire. It's fairly intuitive to pick up and the controls are identical to the hugely playable COD4.

Graphics
The graphics in COD5 are excellent. The environments are detailed and the map size is up on COD4 with some truly sprawling levels this time around. The Berlin levels leading to the Reichstag are simply incredible with brilliant artwork and modelling that truly represents the bombed-out city at the end of the War. The amount of popup (where items suddenly pop in to view) is lessened compared to COD4 but it's still very noticable, especially when approaching the windows of a building to look out. As with COD4, to start with you won't notice it, but once it catches your eye, you'll see it everywhere. The smoke and particle effects have been heavily modified this time around and are much improved. The smoke grenades in particular do not stress the PS3 anywhere near as much as they did in the previous game. There are specular highlights and bump maps used where you'd expect them to be used to pretty good effect. One of the neatest effects is the visual distortion you get around the muzzle of a gun during gunfire, or around an exploding grenade. Nice touch.
New in COD5 is ""graphic"" content, by which I mean mutilated bodies. With the advent of the flamethrower - a truly terrible weapon - you will be presented with burned, mutilated bodies as a result. In multiplayer mode, your character takes damage now too - step on a landmine and in the instant replay you'll see your leg blown off with nothing but a bloody stump remaining. For the parents or squeamish, these effects can all be turned off though.

Sound
The audio on COD-WAW is also improved somewhat on the previous game. There's good stereo separation at the front and excellent use of the rear channels. Often you'll be able to hear someone behind you giving you more reaction time to do something about it. The weapons effects are OK and they use the subwoofer to good effect. Again there's noticable differences in weapons types, with and without suppressors, but I suppose only a classic gun nut would be able to tell you if they're right.

Single player
Single player mode is a good intro to World At War. The maps are varied and as I said in the intro, the missions are split between US and Russian troops. Each mission is a mission-on-rails in that you really can't deviate much from what the developers want you to do. Go from A to B. Kill everything. Collect item. It's a tired formula but I guess it still works. The game is mercifully short on cut-scenes so there isn't a lot of interruption. The cut scenes that do exist are a split between pre-rendered and game-engine scenes. As with all COD games, one level stands out head and shoulders above the rest, and this time around, for me it was the fleet defence mission. You find yourself as a gunner in a US flying boat trying to defend part of the US fleet against Japanese attack. The aircraft in question has 4 guns - left and right waist, nose and tail. The brilliant thing is that you can swap to the different guns, and when you do, rather than simply cut to the new position, you run through the aircraft, past other crew members to the new gunnery station. The first time I played this level it was an unexpected gem in the otherwise ground-based game. Having said that, the three maps leading to the toppling of the Reichstag in Berlin are also worthy of note because of the sheer scale and detail.
One fun addition is the Nazi Zombies level. Once you finish the single player game once, there is a one-off level that you can play where you are locked in an abandoned house. Nazi zombies swarm the house and your job is to kill as many as you can before being overwhelmed. You can rebuild window barricades as they are pulled down by the attacking horde but it takes time - time you don't often have. There are extra sections of the house that can be unlocked once you have enough points. The advantage is that more powerful weapons exist elsewhere in the house, but then so do more doors and windows for the zombies to get in. There are a couple of awards - instant kill, nuke, and 2x points. Ultimately you'll be mauled to death by a hideous Michael-Jackson-Thriller-like zombie with glowing eyes, but how many can you take down before it happens. This is actually a surprisingly fun level to play and re-play although it's not obvious why it was included in World At War.

Online
Online gameplay is where COD-WAW really shines in terms of fun factor. As with COD4, there's a load-balancing system so newbies don't drop into maps with 8 year old Korean kids who can snipe them through glitches in the map. The experience points (XP) system is present and correct as are the commensurate unlocks and and challenges. The more kills you get, the more matches you play, the more experience points you get. These unlock the challenges and the ability to make your own weapons load (instead of choosing one of the predetermined ones) as well as perks. Perks are things like the ability to carry three grenades instead of one.

There are a bunch of different online modes ranging from the usual capture the flags (Domination, straight from Halo), to headquarters, search-and-destroy and outright free-for-all and deathmatch. Team Tactical is a neat mode where each time only has three players, so the games become a lot more tactical. That mode also relies on headset chat otherwise you'll be running around completely uncoordinated. A new addition to World At War is the ""War"" multiplayer mode which is similar to Domination except that it's a proper staged battle across a map. The teams start either side and have to push towards the other team's base camp by capturing the flags as they go. The more you capture, and the more kills you get, the more 'momentum' your team builds. More momentum means quicker flag captures and respawns, which in effect rewards you for teamplay. The better you play as a team, the easier it becomes for you to overwhelm the opposing team with force.
In addition, there are now vehicles in some multiplayer maps - typically tanks. They have two positions - driver/gunner and machinegunner, so up to two players can get in and roam around the map reaping destruction. There are vehicle challenges to go with this new feature - miles driven, most people killed with the main gun etc., and there are also anti-tank weapons and sticky mines so that foot-soldiers stand some chance of taking out the armour. This is a nice touch but I can't help but wonder if it was put in in an effort to compete with the Battlefield series of games.
As with COD4 there are instant rewards in multiplayer. Three kills and you get aerial reconaissance, meaning you can see the other team's locations on your map. Five in a row and you get artillery. Seven in a row and you get to call in the dogs. Opinion is split on the dogs. Some people preferred the helicopter in COD4, but I sort of like the dogs idea. If you're quick, you can actually defend yourself against a dog attack. With the helicopter, you had no choice but to hide.

New to World at War is cooperative gameplay. This is where you can play with other players instead of against them. For example having 4 of you locked in the nazi zombie level, or trying to complete campaign missions with 3 other players instead of the computer-controlled AI characters. This is a nice addition and it has all its own awards and challenges to be completed too.

The biggest drawback of the online play is that the code still isn't distributed. This means that one person's machine is hosting the game. If they get annoyed at losing a battle, or being shot too many times, they can cancel the entire match, resulting in a ""host ended session"" message for everyone else. This is really nasty. In World At War, they do seem to have tried to implement code that migrates the host but it doesn't seem to work. Worse still, the send-you-to-the-same-game bug is still very prominent. If you're playing online and you decide you want out of the game, you can quit and go back to the multiplayer lobby. The problem is that if you then try to find another game, it will invariably dump you right back into the one you just left. Worse still, they still haven't solved the issue where it dumps you into games that have either just ended, or are within a couple of points of ending. This means you spend a considerable amount of time being shuttled from host to host just trying to find a game that is about to start. This and this alone is why I took a star off the review for this game. It was bad in COD4 and it should have been fixed. The fact that these problems still exist is inexcusable.

Trophies
World At War supports the PS3's new trophy system. There are dozens to collect both in single player, multiplayer online and co-op modes.

Four stars or five?
Very few games deserve 5-star rating at this point. Developers are still learning how best to get everything they can out of the PS3. Giving a game 5 stars implies the developers have nowhere left to turn for future improvements. This happens rarely although because of the improvements over COD4 I was willing to go the 5-star route. The improvements in the game engine, the sound effects, the smoke and explosion effects, and the engaging gameplay all help to raise the bar, but as I said above, the fact that it still suffers the abominable problems with multiplayer hosting are reason enough to bring the rating down again.
It's quick to pick up and the online play, despite the server glitches, still has a high X-factor. As with COD4 it's hard to say what makes the game so much fun but it has that certain something that will probably keep you coming back. In the end, that's what it's all about. You can have all the hype and fanfare you like, but if your game has spectacular graphics, a long and twisting storyline but no fun factor, people won't play it. COD-WAW has good graphics, good sound, mercifully little storyline and it's fun to play.",4.0,B001AWBYNE,World War II in hi-def.,Video Games

-The story was good. It could have been flushed out a little more but I think the DLC is working on that.
-Voice acting is good. I really found the Taken creepy.
-The gameplay is unique. I like that you don't just shoot and shoot and shoot, you need the flashlights, the flares and all that. It was cool.

The not so good.
-WHY CAN'T ALAN RUN?!?!?! He shuffles along for about 5 seconds and then gets winded. I mean seriously, you've got a dark, shadowy, chainsaw wielding possessed monster chasing you. RUN MAN!
-The save game spots. Yes they are in good spots as far as saving after you do something hard, but they make you save the game right before some tedious task, which you have to repeat if you die.

"I picked up this collection of oldies but goodies around 2003 or 2004. There's 14 games plus two bonus games you can ""unlock"" with high scores. The games are:

Pac Man
Ms. Pac Man
Galaga
Galaxian
Dig Dug
Rally-X
Pole Position 1 & 2
Xevious
Dragon Spirit
Bosconian
Rolling Thunder
Mappy
Sky Kid

Bonus games:

Pac-Mania
Galaga 88

I did not detect anything different from these games and their arcade counterparts, like some other die-hard game reviewers did. Like the Activision Anthology, this collection also has an 80s soundtrack of different songs to listen to while you're choosing your options. My favorites are the Pac Man and Pole Position games, Galaxian, Dig Dug and Xevious. I got into Mappy and Rally-X a little, they're fun ""cute type"" games. I tried Bosconian and Sky Kid a couple of times. In order to play the bonus games, you must achieve a high score on their related games. The instruction booklet does NOT say what those scores are.

Now the bad stuff. You can choose options (number of lives, etc.) but going from screen to screen seems to take a long time. It's like you're saying ""Come on already"" waiting for the next screen. Once the game starts, you must play it through. You can't go back to the beginning, though I believe you can pause the game if the phone or doorbell rings. When the game is over, you must start from the beginning. You can't pick up from the level you were at, which is annoying as all Hell. And like the others have said, other than the two bonus games, there's no special features like interviews or anything like that. It would've been nice, but oh well.

I have three of the PS1 Namco collections, but here at least most of the ""biggies"" are on one disc. Despite the slow loading, this disc is mostly a ""must have"" if you were around in the 80s.

"I must start out that there will never be a RPG game better than the original Baldur's Gate.
The problem here with the sequel is that instead of giving you a quality game, they did what everyone else does in the computer game world and changed it in a bad way.  I have no idea where they get the system requirements for this one.  I have a brand new system with a voodoo card and the game is very choppy and it sucks.  Great, the story line is better and the game is bigger, but it is very frustrating to play whenever combat starts and the screen jumps around worse than the first game.
Give me a break, Bioware.  Spend all that time making endless dialogue and new spells and such, but when you take away playability then the thing might as well jump out at me from the screen, because it is still going to be no fun whatsoever to play.
Buy this one only if you have a big money gaming computer and lots of patience, because it will drive you crazy otherwise.",3.0,B00004KHB7,"Same old game, more problems...",Video Games

"First let me say I've never played a Forza game in my life. I tend to not like racetrack games nor sim games. Normally I purchase Need for Speed Titles, and a Test Drive Unlimited here and there, also your standard Open World Action games like Grand Theft Auto and Sleeping Dogs and the like. Those last ones aren't real racing games but they have a lot of elements. So thats my background coming into Horizon, more Arcade racing experience. Now let me say Horizon is probably in the middle of arcade and sim in my opinion, the cars feel 'heavier' and hug the road more then I was use to even with all the driving assists on. This is not a complaint however, the mix of arcade and sim here felt good, and it didn't take me long to get the 'feel' for it. I did turn the road guide off, as I found it distracting to have a green line to tell you how your driving is, but that option is there. I managed to place 1st place in every race so far, so I think it does a good job of scaling for people who are coming in from the Arcade-y/NFS background like me. I cant say anything about the Sim aspects so I'll move on.

The world itself is beautiful, and to me at least there seems like a lot of cars. The showroom in the game lists over 130 vehicles for purchase, though I am unsure if there are more hidden in the game. This is a lot compared to most Arcade racing games, so personally I'm happy with the number, though I find it disappointing all the best brands are represented but Porsche, however I understand this has to do with licensing issues involving EA Games so I cant blame the developers for that, however the Porsche knockoff RUF are available, so it softens that blow.

All in all I'd recommend it for arcade racing fans looking to come over from Need For Speed or Test Drive Unlimited, the game play is great and while the cars are more sim-y then I am personally use to, it works out nicely.

As for why I knocked off a star from the rating overall, its because a stupid decision, probably on the part of Microsoft rather then the developers drags the experience down. Apparently you are unable to claim any in-game gift cars for purchasing game Unless you have a Xbox Live Gold account. Shame on Microsoft for that, its a gift from the Community team, and yet it tells you that you must be a gold member to claim them. Even the bonus car Dodge car from playing the demo and the bonus Saleen from buying the game in the first week are not available unless you pony up for a gold membership. A Total new low, I've never in my life played a game where such bonuses are held hostage.",4.0,B002I0H1J8,Great Racer,Video Games

"I initially got this system just to play Pokmon Alpha Sapphire I fell in love with it though. The 3D is a bit of a gimmic, but damn it's fun to show off. Plus, it does add emersion to some areas of games.

The screen resolution is great on official Nintendo services/ profucts. It really lacks resolution for things like youtube/ browser (which is awkward to get used to) and it's about average on regular DS games. But it's not 'bad' especially since it's a game system, not an iphone.

The system it self is simply beautiful. It's a matte (thank god) white, but the mickey heads are glossy. The inside/ back are just white, which was what I wanted. It's a big system, but it still fits in my pocket.

I bought the clear plastic Hori case to put on it, as the Mickey heads seem like they could be rubbed off eventually. The case is slightly 'cloudy' but it doesn't show much with this version. I also got Hori screen protectors, which seem pretty nice so far. I highly suggest putting screen protectors on before you turn this thing on. A case is a good idea too, for the finish.

I *would* tell anyone to get this, but with the 'new 3DS' I think it's up to prefrence. The new one does seem to be upgraded, but the finish was wonderful on this one. I chose it over the new 3DS mainly for looks. Mine was fairly late on shipping, but that was a bank-mess up.

"I've been calling myself a ""lapsed Final Fantasy fan"" for quite some time now. This opinion has started many a flame war on the internet, and quite frankly, I've never understood why. It's hard to defend the sharp nose-dive in quality that the series has taken in recent years. Tetsuya Nomura and Motomu Toriyama have steered what was once supposed to be a series about grand, sweeping adventures into an edgy, grimdark pit occupied by pretty teenagers wearing lots of buckles and zippers.

Numerous spin-offs, only a small percentage of which are decent, have saturated the brand name. The core series has somehow gotten less robust and interesting than it once was, with XIII being a series of ornate hallways, XIV being an MMO that, while decent, apes a lot from better, less costly games, and XV looking to be a cribbing of both Monster Hunter and the worst elements of Western AAA games... not to mention possessing the most obnoxious cast to date. While this is just my opinion, I do find it a bit baffling that anybody would adamantly defend the choices Nomura and Toriyama have made, polluting a series that once gave us excellent titles like IV, VI, VII, IX, X and some of the early spin-offs. Different strokes, I guess.

And, looking at Final Fantasy Type-0 HD (it was originally a Japan-only PSP title back in 2011,) I really expected more of the same. Long, complicated, fake words that do nothing other than make the story a convoluted garble of boring lore. Characters that look ripped from the cover of Tiger Beat, decked out with zippers that do nothing and lead to nowhere. Boring, generic gameplay that simply allows the player to go from point A to B, and nothing more. Imagine my surprise, then, that Type-0 is not only the best entry in the Final Fantasy series to hit a home console since the PS2 days, but simultaneously one of the most engaging RPGs and exciting action games I've played on a current-gen console. It has problems, yes. Undoubtedly. But it's a step in the right direction.

But the plot could fool you into thinking otherwise, initially. There's a school called Akademia (snort) that trains elite soldiers to train in the front lines of a raging war between four nations. All of these students have different abilities, strengths, weaknesses, so on, so forth. One military, in particular, is trying to wage war on all of the nations, and take everything under their iron fist, and it's up to Akademia and their growing list of allies to team up and overthrow the threat. But, despite looking pretty decent on the surface, the intent behind Akademia and its enigmatic head might not be all that they seem. Or... something.

Yes, as people who have played this game so far might notice, that is a very, very pared-down version of the narrative. Honestly,  Type-0, despite gradually growing into an engaging, interesting game, still suffers from problems hallmark to Final Fantasy games made in the last ten years. That is to say, the narrative is jam-packed with moronically-spelled words, all crammed together at once, in hopes of building a deep, intricate world with lots to learn about.

In actuality, though, it only results in a story that's interesting until people try to actually explain what's happening using made-up lingo. Yes, there are things to help understand it somewhat, but I've always felt that's a bad narrative decision. Your story should make sense and not be packed to the brim with whimsical buzzwords to begin with, which should then stimulate me to learn more, not the other way around. It's not as egregious as the worst parts of XIII, which is apparently part of the same canon, but it can get pretty obnoxious. At least, though, the surface level, bare bones narrative makes enough sense to follow and be engaged by, and again, it does pick up once things get rolling.

Luckily, though, the similarities to modern Final Fantasy games end there. Unlike XIII, which made you play for 30-40 hours until the gameplay turned into something more than ""press X and sometimes use an Eidolen to win,"" Type-0 is fun and stimulating right from the get-go. After the lengthy intro, you're dropped straight into combat, and it's soon thereafter that you'll start to realize that this is, mechanically, one of the best entries in the franchise. Playing like a pared-down version of a Devil May Cry-type affair, we have a game that's part action, part role-playing, all fun.

Each of the fourteen characters play in a distinctly different way, meaning that players can experiment with both main campaign missions and side quests until they find the party that works for them. Do you want to focus on long-range attacks and buffs, or maybe heavy melee attacks and attack spells? There are dozens of possible combinations, so players are bound to find something they like with all of the choice. There's not really a definitive ""best"" type of trio to have, and it ultimately boils down to how you want to play. Personally, I always find that to be the most rewarding type of game, and I commend the devs for breaking from the traditional ""this is how you do X thing exactly"" rut that Final Fantasy games often find themselves stuck in. It's pretty neat stuff.

There's also a ton of different stuff to do on top of the solid base of fast-paced action. This makes for the most Final Fantasy-y Final Fantasy in a while, surprisingly enough. Players can explore Akademia, getting to know the student body, upgrading their characters and attending different classes to strengthen their party en masse. They can take up side-quests to get items, level up, and just find new stuff. They can explore the world map, gradually unlocking more as the campaign continues, and gett lost in optional side-dungeons or cities. There's a ton to here, really, and that's quite the surprise for me. Most action-oriented spin-offs of this series have been linear, not matching up the open-world epic quest feeling of the main games. Now, though, Type-0 ironically feels a lot more like what the franchise is supposed to be than the core games, and that's something worth celebrating, I feel.

It's also worth noting that there are light RTS elements sprinkled into the campaign when players overthrow or protect regions, and they're implemented in such a way that it feels like a natural, fun shift, as opposed to unnecessary drudgery. It's nice that this isn't another ActRaiser situation: fun core mechanics, dull progression.

There's very little about this game that I'd call dull, actually. Very little, though, not nothing, because honestly, the way that players find themselves leveling their characters is a bit of a slog, and not in line with the fun, streamlined nature of the rest of the package. In fact, I wasn't even completely aware I could upgrade anything until multiple hours into the experience. Done at save crystals, players will use points accrued through leveling up to strengthen their characters of choice, and the experience is quite the tedious one. A long list with annoying pop-ups that are slow to disappear, the process through which players upgrade their characters is monotonous and takes way longer than it should, especially with fourteen effing characters to maintain. It's a royal pain, and an unwelcome departure from a series that has introduced ingenious leveling mechanics like the Sphere Grid and the Crystarium.

My sentiments are the same for the process of upgrading spells. When players kill enemies, they explode their corpses (!) and synthesize special gems from them. These gems are used to strengthen magic, and lord, is it easily the worst part of the game. Each element of spell has a series of sub-spells that are only differentiated by confusing acronyms, and not, you know, actual names. And all of the characters have different types of acronym spells, and you have to access a separate screen to see who knows what, and, well, you're probably beginning to see the problem here. You'll end up wasting gems you earned in battle upgrading the wrong spell for the wrong character, without even knowing you're doing so. The system in place here is clunky and unnecessarily complicated, and could have done with more streamlining. It reeks of being limited by its original platform, and not being upgraded for home consoles. Four years after release, that's a bit of a letdown.

You know what else wasn't upgraded for home consoles? A lot of the visuals, because, easily, this is one of the most badly textured games on modern consoles. Some of the textures are literally ripped straight from the PSP, and look godawful when blown up on a bigger screen. The same can be said for 80-90% of the NPC models, who are disturbingly static, never doing anything beyond standing in uncomfortable poses and moving ever-so-slightly to simulate breathing. Some parts of this game are simply ugly and a brutal letdown for a series that's always prided itself on sharp visuals.

But the odd thing is, it's only some of the textures. Other textures and models and whatnot look astounding, and more in line with what I expect for my sixty-dollar purchase from a AAA publisher. Namely, places you're doing battle and the characters you're controlling look fantastic, and make me long for a version of this game that looks consistently good. It's a bit jarring when a beautifully rendered and animated model is standing next to a static one rendered with muddy textures from a handheld. Yes, the exaggerated motion blur and carefully positioned lighting makes you not notice the visual flaws at times, but it takes only a cursory look to see that this game is not what it could be in the looks department, and that's a real shame. The art direction is great and all, but sometimes, that can only go so far.

At the very least, though, the soundtrack is gorgeous. It's the signature mixture of electronic and orchestral sensibilities that has anchored the series since the early 2000's, and it works just as well here as it ever has. In particular, the remixes of classic tunes, like the main theme of the series (used for the background of Akademia) and the darker version of the Chocobo theme (used for the overworld theme) are fantastic. The battle themes are nothing to sneeze at, either, and a bit catchy as well. Oh, and that classic ""victory theme"" is just as good ever, and makes leveling up feel that much more satisfying.

Is Final Fantasy Type-0 HD a good game? Undoubtedly, yes. It's the best game in the franchise for way, way too long, and has hours of fun, engaging content that'll keep you busy for quite some time, on top of having a load of replay value. But on the flip side, is it all that it could be? No, not quite. The leveling system is flat-out dull, the visuals aren't up to snuff for a sixty dollar game on a home console, and the plot still has a lot of the same niggling flaws as other entries where Tetsuya Nomura and Motomu Toriyama have been at the reigns.

The end result is a game that recaptures what the series is supposed to be all about, but is still held back by some meandering issues that prevent the game from being a gung-ho, balls-out return to glory. Still, though, it's hard to deny that this is a very good game with a lot of great things going for it, and for fans jaded after a series of duds, that's more than enough reason to pick this up.

Pros
- Interesting story and world
- Fantastic core gameplay
- Lots of diverse content
- Pleasing art direction
- Great soundtrack

Cons
- Underwhelming visuals
- Dull leveling systems
- Counter-intuitive menus
- Still a convouluted Nomura/Toriyama joint

"I bought this mainly for the charging station but also needed a back up headset. The dock has a blue light all around the base when it is plugged in also when you place the dead controller on it that half shows a red glow instead of blue until it is charged. made the mistake of putting in master bedroom and it is not very conducive to sleeping. The headset works great but I have found my head is entirely too small and it digs into my ear but fit my husbands head perfectly (he has a rather large head). also the wires break very easily on the headset by the ear piece as well as the plug in. the clips inside the microphone boom broke so instead of having limited rotation it can now turn freely which added to me liking it as the mic was at a strange angle and not for either ear for me.

Gameplay wise, it is less of a shooter and more like a haunted house; a damned good haunted house.  EVERYTHING in the game is scripted, which will probably limit replay value, but it plays like a damned movie!  Play this with the lights down low - it's one helluva ride ;)

"Fable's main plot reads more like a book of clichd, overused storyline elements than the attention-grabbing, emotion-fluttering heavyweight it was so obviously meant to be. The nameless lead character is introduced to us as a young boy, enjoying the last few days of his innocence, when a surprise bandit raid results in the senseless slaughter of every living soul in his hometown. And, just as the bandits are about to finish the deed by wiping our young narrator from the face of the planet, he's saved at the last moment by a powerful warrior who takes the boy under his wing and trains him at his nationally-recognized ""hero school."" I'm sure you can imagine where the story leads from there... a never-ending hunt for clues about the fate of his family, and a bloodthirsty search for revenge. Well... maybe ""bloodthirsty"" is a bit too strong of a word for this uncharismatic main character, since the limits of his emotional range seem to be mild annoyance and very slight pleasure.

There's no connection whatsoever between the main character and the main villain (which is, generally speaking, supposed to be the story's ""home run"" relationship) so their ultimate collision means next to nothing. Avoiding all the sidequests, the main plot itself is really quite short and despite all the emphasis on your decisions throughout the game affecting its outcome, the one single decision that makes a difference doesn't arrive until after you've laid the finishing touches on the end boss.

In about as short a terms as I can define it, this game plays like a mixture of Onimusha, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic and The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker. Obviously, with the storyline's central focus being the main character's constant struggle between darkness and light, (and the way his everyday decisions affect that status) the comparisons to KOTOR almost write themselves. Your appearance slowly changes from everyday to angelic to demonic, depending on your decisions, and is gradual enough to keep the player from noticing straight away. Likewise, by increasing your attributes in the strength or magic departments, you either slowly grow in size and stature or whither away into a shriveled, powerful magician.

Like Onimusha, you don't receive the experience from your battles until you've chased down the little glowing green bubble that bursts out of the bodies of your fallen opponents. The EXP will fade away if you don't get to it in time, but you can give it a little tug in your direction by holding the ""R"" button. Accumulated experience can be spent on different abilities, (such as additional strength, the capacity to take more damage, better aim with your bow and arrow, more spells to cast in the heat of a battle, extra speed, etc.) as though you were merely shopping for items.

And, like all of Zelda's post-N64 titles, the actual hackin' and slashin' is both challenging and enjoyable. You'll occasionally run into trouble trying to target a specific enemy in a horde, or maintaining a lock on your target while dodging arrows and blades, but that's acceptable and actually quite a ways more realistic than most of the competition. Plus, the battle system itself is loose enough to make correcting for these quirks a snap. You can choose between fighting close range with a blade, short or long range with a bow and arrow, or any distance with your magic, with each method offering unique pros and cons.

As you make your way through the game, you retrieve your main quests from the ""Hero School"". Apparently, a big part of the school's (and your character's) funding comes from the completion of various tasks, missions and requests as proposed by the world's citizens in need. Your quests range from ""help the merchant through the dark, scary woods"" to ""hunt down and decapitate the bandit mastermind,"" and are all over the board in terms of difficulty, length and reward. Gameplay is a dream come true.

The graphics are tough to classify. On one hand, they don't even compare to the photorealism of some of their contemporaries, but on the other... they don't really aim to. There's a visual flair to the graphics of Fable, a distinct style that alludes to photorealism but retains the kind of personality, emotion and, for lack of a better word, humanity, that's missing from most games. While they don't look exactly like the kind of people you'd see walking down the dirt roads of the local renaissance festival, they've got just as much emotion in their expressions, reactions and personal flair.

The audio is a home run. The villagers have almost thousands of different expressions, reactions, quips, comments and responses to fit any situation. The easily-identifiable British accent of every character in the game helps Fable stand apart from the pack, and solidifies its timeframe somewhere in the middle ages. The villagers even borrow a few lines from Monty Python's Search for the Holy Grail, and while that's one of the most wrongfully-quoted movies of all time, it's used sparingly and effectively here and feels more like a funny side joke than an annoying, forced homage. The musical score is minimal, and the occasionally-necessary transition from the ""wandering alone in the forest"" theme to the ""ambushed by thieves"" theme is quick, seamless and effortless. It does its job.

Basically, in Fable you've got a game that looks great, sounds great, plays like a dream, incorporates some unique new gameplay elements, features some outstanding voice acting, attempts to perfect on some tried-and-true existing mechanics, and simply lacks any sort of mentionable storyline. If you can live with making that one sacrifice to enjoy all the greatness that surrounds it, you'll really enjoy yourself with this. The big problem here wasn't necessarily in the game itself, but in all the hype and delays that cornered the title before it could even hit the market and the lack of focus on a clear, interesting story.",4.0,B0001UEHP8,"Superb gameplay, refreshing graphics, sub-standard storyline",Video Games

"I have been waiting in anticipation for over a year for this game, I am so happy to be the owner of it now. It ships with a reletively large single player story mode, and a in depth creation mode. The single player levels are very well desinged and fun to play (for the entire family) but the bread and butter of the game is in the creation mode (for me). They give you great tools, no, amazing tools and materials to creat.... Whatever you want! I saw a you tube video of a guy who made a working 8bit calculator for example. Some of the tools are- piston: move up and down or back and for pushing or pulling objects to your liking, Bolts - hold material you want together, it rotates freely or controlled by using differnt types of bolts, elastic: example you could make a bugie cord. Those are a few of the cool tools I like to use, and you get better and better as you make more.

"This'll be a fairly short review- there are others that can and have said it better and in more depth that I could. The short of it is that IF you're a Halo fan or know one- this is a must. Granted, I'm not speaking of the brainless trigger finger kids that feel that Halo is their outlet for shooting other mindless morons in the face and gloating non-stop about it- I'm talking about the Halo fans that love the game only as much as they love the fiction and the universe Bungie created. Halo Wars not only tells a great story (an original story) with stunning, top of the line CGI, but it also has a LOT of answers to many questions most Halo fans have been asking for years.

And to the NON-Halo fan, if you're looking for a console RTS that works amazingly well for the medium, this is IT. I've played EVERY RTS on EVERY Console, this is the ONLY one that I would recommend. Because we lack the Keyboard and Mouse set up of PC gamers, we need an RTS that works with a controller... and that's what Ensemble gave us. This is fast, easy and becomes second nature almost immediately. The fun of an RTS is being in control of a large army and watching the controlled chaos unfold. PC gamers would argue that it's about setting up the micro management aspects of RTS's and that may be true for some, but the action of Halo Wars is perfect for sitting on the couch and getting the action started in 20 seconds versus 20 minutes.

Give Halo Wars a shot with the demo that's available on XBL, but know that it truly only scratches the surface of the entire game.",5.0,B0017HW5LM,The best RTS on any console. A must for Halo fans to boot.,Video Games

"I don't have much that I can say about this game that is good. The story line didn't make this game worth while, and while the gameplay was better than FF VIII the character models were iritatingly childish. This is what we get from the systems that accuses Nintendo of being nothing but kiddie games? You can't have cutsie cartoony characters swear and pass it off as not being kiddie crap, and I'm sorry, but that's what this game was. It wasn't even an epic kiddie game like Mario, or Pokemon, what this was wasa mediocre last ditch attempt to try and sqeeze some much needed cash out of the franchise, and while it wasn't entirely unlikeable, it was such a throwback to older games that it was completely unoriginal, and there in lied it's problem. It's plot, characters, etc were all rehash from past FF games. There are moments of silliness that will force a smile out of you, but I found myself anxious to have the game overwith, and never bothered to dig into side quests, bonus Eidilons or any of that. Had FF IX been FF VIII maybe I would have liked it better, but to spoil me with FF VIII's graphics, then expect me to be happy with the super deformed kiddie garbage is unfair.

"Pros: gameplay, definitely has to be the game play, and the SOUND, The feel of World War II's realism factor doesn't get any better but here, First Mission, WW2 Depicted Well, Incredible gameplay, unreal sound, historically accurate, excellent game, Music, a good variety of levels, good choice of authentic weapons, By far the best war game out on the Playstation 2. Realistic and gripping!
Cons: frame rate, controls take a bit of getting use to because of the sensitivity, Replay Value, over-sensitive, some rendering quality, wish it was fully 5.1 format, A bit hard, Sometimes shaky aiming control, seems like TOO much fun to be healthy, What happened to Tom Hanks?, Real as this game is it would've been nice if there was some blood, Too short, not enough cinematic sequences between missions, Maybe a bit too fast paced for some, levels can get repetitive, Becomes too linear in latter stages and little replay value once completed.

"For those who have played the first two Way of the Samurai titles, you know what to expect here with the third installment. For the unintitated, it would be best to know what this game is not. It's not GTA with swords or a hack-and-slash game, it's purely a decision-based system in which you tell the story where to go by triggering inklings or scenes or behaving differently. Killing innocents and looting them or saving people from injustice and defending yourself with blunt attacks clearly imply 2 ways you can play the game but they don't necessarily guarantee you the same ending. No matter how you end the game, however, it begins in the same fashion. You're found on the battlefield within an inch of your life by two looters and, one way or another, you are led to a farming village where a cot is set up for you. From this point on, the fate of the town and its people is in your hands.

There are several endings, over 20 of them, which can take you anywhere from 30 minutes to a few hours to complete. Beating the game or leaving the town altogether, reseting the game, will result in the end of that play session and the final summation of ""samurai points"" you have attained. for every act of villainy such as kicking an unarmed villager or slashing/killing people who don't deserve it or are unarmed will decrease your total by 50 while progressing into a story branch and/or obtaining titles through play such as Rich Samurai for having 10,000 mon on you will raise that base total which adds or subtracts from your points bank - rewarding you with new faces/outfits/accessories/safes to hold weapons/difficulties/etc. Wanna look like Gackt in a tuxedo weilding a blacksmith hammer? Go for it.

Now to play devil's advocate: It's fun, definitely, and I'm still playing it. Over 30 hours in so far, personally, but the replay value is different for all people. For the Gears/God of War crowd, this may be too much of a chore with how slow-paced it can be or its lackluster graphics (yes, it's not Killzone 4 but no one's playing this for its looks). If you like the idea of a game being significantly different depending on whether or not you bowed to that woman or spoke negatively about that clan, you're in for a treat because while it doesn't have the same dialogue branching detail as a Bioware title, the story itself goes in another direction. That said, the con side to this is that you don't know exactly what choice will equal a desired result, which either results in trial and error or having to be faithful to a guide written by gamers. Yeah, forget about a strategy guide or in-depth explanation within the game itself, any and all support for all the titles in this series has and will come from the fans.

If you're willing to engross yourself in its world or are playing along with a guide, that's your best bet for knowing all you need to know about WotS3 and you'll still either love or hate this game. But if you're interested thus far, you may end up becoming a fan once you get used to its inner workings and controls. By no means is this a AAA title but it has so many complex nuances that makes it at the very least worth a hard look.

"I haven't been a fan of MK since after MK II for the Arcades and Super NES. I've tried all the sequels but they just weren't for me, especially the last 4 for the PlayStation and PS2.

MK vs. DC brings this series back to it's roots and it's a lot of fun. The fatalities can be lame but they still do what they're supposed to - give you closure to a hard fought victory.

The fighting engine is a little stiff but it doesn't hinder the game play and you get used to it relatively quickly. Besides, I found it more enjoyable that Soul Calibur 4.

Bottom lins is that the game is fun. I received it today and played through the arcade mode with Scorpion and I can't wait to play through it with the other 19 characters.

I hope Midway keeps this engine and fine tunes it for future MK releases. Here's also hoping that the next one is a mature game too. I like the DC characters though and this is a nice one-off game.",5.0,B0017ZIIK6,Love it,Video Games

""Playground"" makes an excellent addition to our Wii library of games and both the single-player and multi-player modes will get a good workout from us.  This one is actually simpler than&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Carnival-Games/dp/B000QD7BBM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Carnival Games</a>&nbsp;which I also recommend as a ""kid friendly"" game.

Basically, you wander around the playground collecting marbles and challenge other children to various games to earn stickers to place in your sticker book.  Many smaller kids will find this feature quite appealing.  My favorite games so far are the slot cars, paper airplanes, and dodgeball.  All are simple enough (at least at the beginning) for most children to play.  For example, tetherball is exceptionally simple at the outset.  As you gain experience and skills, you will unlock more advanced versions of the games and new games as well. The game increases in difficulty as you progress.

As with most Wii games, don't expect stellar graphics quality.  The Wii is aimed towards gameplay rather than graphics and this is another good implementation of the mini-game format for which the Wii is famous.  One thing that does annoy me with the game is that although the text is in English, the children speak in Japanese.  It's kind of cute, but for the price, I'd hope they'd have taken the time to re-dub the audio portions.

Overall, I think my children will find this enjoyable and challenging.  This is a wholesome videogame that I can recommend without qualms.",4.0,B000RHXD28,Great Wii Game For Younger Kids!!,Video Games

"This is insane. You pay so much money (upwards of $120) for a video game to basically suffer your way through this pitiful excuse of a game. You can tell right from the first 20 minutes of gameplay that this was a rushed effort on EA/Dice's part. They basically just wanted to push this game out their doors without having even tested it in order to grab sales before COD:Ghosts. They paid no attention to the huge amount of glitches, bugs, and ugly crashing issues. Why should you have to pay so much to suffer so much even a month after the first release? Listen: there's a reason that even after 370+ reviews BF4 barely has a 2.5 star rating. It really is that bad. Some other complaints:

SINGLE PLAYER:
-Your teammates are useless and can't shoot down one enemy standing not five feet in front of them half the time. Directing them towards that enemy doesn't help much, either.
-Although the story was well thought out, you can tell it was rushed. Campaign can be beaten on Normal difficulty in 6 hours or less. Still an hour or two longer than COD though.
-Less linear than before, which I like, but the scripting is obvious and you can tell when enemy choppers are coming in, when enemy reinforcements pop out of nowhere, etc.
-Enemies take 5 shots to drop them, or 3-4 shots from a 7.62mm DMR. When they get shot, they hardly falter or just shrug it off like it was a mosquito or something.
-Missions are full of bugs, including a few critical bugs that will crash your game and force you to restart the whole mission (there are 8 or so missions total, each with a bazillion objectives to accomplish).
-Ending was just like... Seriously? I won't spoil it for you, but if you ever get BF3.5 - er, I mean, BF4, you'll see what I mean.

MULTIPLAYER
-The crashing. I can't say anything positive until the crashes are fixed permanently.
-The weapons. Sometimes it feels like I'm dying in one hit from a 4-shots-to-kill-assault rifle. I don't know what's different, but in BF3 it actually took a bit of time to kill someone. In this game I feel like I'm sniping people from across the map with a submachine gun (and I have done that before) in less time than it takes to pop a soda can open and take a sip. Weapons have very little recoil and are laser accurate. Suppression is less effective (which can be good or bad depending on your playstyle), but it's almost to the point where I can't tell when I'm being suppressed even half the time.
-The maps are poorly designed and levelution is nothing more than eye candy and an occasional nuisance. No good CQC style maps, and some map spawns are poorly designed (especially for TDM).
-The movement feels so sluggish, which I appreciate for the realism aspect, but sometimes it'll come to the point where my character can vault over a 4 foot high concrete barrier and then have trouble going over a broken wall that's roughly knee-high. It just makes no sense. I have video footage of my character being unable to jump over a really short barrier that he should easily be able to go over even in real life. It's not just jumping over barriers, either. I can't shoot through a flight of stairs that has gaps in between the steps. My bullets can't go through a 0.5 inch thick rusty pipe.
-Vehicles still overpowered. I avoid huge conquest maps because I can never get my hands on a tank or jet and when I do, I get mauled by someone who's already no-lifed their way into a myriad of overpowered unlocked equipment for their vehicle.
-1/3 of the weapons are carried over from BF3, some with the exact same animations.
-Two of the bolt-action sniper rifles require 2 hits to the head at long ranges to kill. This just makes no sense to me regardless of how fast their bolt-action mechanism is.

Seeing as I got it on sale and the campaign was amusing and I managed to have my good moments in game, I'll rate this game 2 stars. I'd like to rate Dice/EA's performance -2 stars. Save your money and go buy something that won't frustrate you.",2.0,B00BXONG7G,Absolutely and positively atrocious job on EA/Dice's part.,Video Games

"Single player loaded and boots right up. Plays smooth no problems on win7. About half my stuff has issues with win7 on my new i7 2600. Nice to know it works.

This is coop all the way. Mapping your own controls works well on pc. It does treat you a bit like an idiot. Go there, hurry up, you are an idiot. I like the lone wolf approach better. Give me an objective and I will get it done.

The coop is kind of cool in that you can charge in, known enemies on the flanks, and your teammates will clean up behind you.

Online will not boot up. I bought it for single player but it should work. Not sure what happened but I turned down the punkbuster install and I don't know if there is a connection. Don't care either.

These are gaming lights from ambx that teamed up with Madcatz's Cyborg PC gaming division to create a 2 point lighting system for games, movies and music. I really love this set, though it's a 2 point lighting system, it would have been nice to have 3 lights. (left, right and center) The program is simple to use and works with every game, music player and movie player. This only works for PC and not for consoles. You can add more lights with a total of 9 lights and if you so want 3 lights per sector, total of 27 LIGHTS! Crazy! Not only does it work for games but you can also set it actions like getting a new email or instant message (setting a color for it) be in sync with you screen saver and setting a static color background. Nothing I can see bad or frustrating about this product other than the price, should have been at least 3 lights for $100",5.0,B005DKZSVS,Background Lights!!!,Video Games

"First, I want to talk.about how user friendly this is. Typing isn't too loud, in a dark room you can change from Purple (bright) or Blue (bright) to Red (dark but still lit) to kill the glare. The ONLY downside to the mouse is I have no idea hoe.to keep it one color. Granted, it's a cool feature to see it change colors all the time, the design is FLAWLESS. But on nights like last night, where I just wanted a dark setting, the mouse was just glaring into the corner of my eye while playing an MMO. The wheel on the mouse is smooth, the mousepad feels incredible, clicking is solid and so far I have had no pain in my hand from extended use.",5.0,B00YBL3W40,I approve.,Video Games
"We got this for my nieces and nephews for Christmas. I'm a real gamer, my wife plays a few games now and then. Neither of us has played any of the other I spy games. We've seen the books, but I haven't found this type of thing interesting since I was little and where's waldo was popular.

We always try out games before we give them to the kids, and usually we play them for 10 or fifteen minutes. I played this for a few hours, and now my wife's addicted too! We're sure the kids are going to love it too! You just zoom around and find whatever is in the riddle. Some of it's hard to find, but us adults have always found everything.

So you have to move around a 3-d level and find the items in a riddle. There are about 10 items per riddle and in all there are 40 riddles. The movements you can make are limited (your movements are on ""rails""). This is actually a good thing since it it's impossible to get lost.

It's not given a 5 because it's a ""perfect game"", but because it does enough right to get played a lot in my house. I got it cheap because of a special deal. I don't think it's a must buy at $30, but it's definitely a great buy when it becomes a budget game.

I don't know how long it will be for sure yet, but I'm guessing that it will take us adults somewhere in the 8-10 hour range to finish it (40 riddles with 10 to 15 minutes each). I think it will take the kids longer.

Cons:
1. Sometimes the controls are a little wonky. Never had more than a momentary problem, so it's not a game killer. Also, sometimes you need to hit the number 2. Why games that control mainly with the arrow keys, a & b make you also hit the 2 button is beyond me.
2. This isn't a con if you play with your kids. Some things may need adult help--especially for kids who can't read. One of the clues is a ""rebus 4 U"". You're supposed to find the letter U, but they should have just put ""find the letter 'U'"". Clues that hard are rare. The game requires reading in some puzzles where you have to find words. Etc. Reading ones are common.
3. The gameplay is repetitive, but it's 'I spy'. What do you expect? But, I didn't like how some of the mini-games where repetitive. Kids may enjoy that repetition. There also are only 10 levels that you visit a number of times (there are 40 puzzles, so I assume you'll visit each level 4 times).

Pros:
1. Non violent puzzle fun that everyone can help with. Even though only one player controls the wiimote, my wife and I have so far sat at the tv and pointed things out to each other.
2. Good 3d graphics. Nothing amazing, but if it were just a 2d where's waldo on the wii, we wouldn't like it near as much!
3. The actual pointing at items and moving around the level is very accurate. You can use the arrow keys to move around, but the nunchuk works great too!
4. There are a few nice additions. There is a final goal in building this machine. You can play the mini-games with a second player (not interesting to us adults).
5. Auto saving. It's 2008, why doesn't every game autosave?

"I would like to say the game has excellent graphics and great audio. I was impressed in the beginning of the game. The combat and gameplay was good, but after an hour or so the gameplay was becoming tedious (boring).

I realized you have to do the same objectives (with different bosses)over and over again. Don't get me wrong, the bosses were epic but to get through one circle (stage) to the other circle and to defeat the bosses was very repetitive. Furthermore, I felt the story was lacking substance, because it talks about his seven sins with a brief cinematic scene...that's all. Also, the way you collect a Judas coin, a relic or any other other object you do it in the same fashion: pull out your cross and hit circle several times.

Having said that, I would recommend to get God of War 3, because the developers are known to add originality and better story lines for the God of War franchise--we all know that God of War III will be on a massive scale.",2.0,B001NX6GBK,SAVE YOUR MONEY FOR GOD OF WAR 3,Video Games

"Well, Deception probably has the greatest opening sequence that I've ever seen in any game, whether it be fighting game, racing or RPG, and the endings are really awesome.  Other than that, the core gameplay hasn't changed much from Deadly Alliance aside from combo breakers, and that's not such a good thing in my mind.  Although the likeness of the Chess and Puzzle Kombat mini games (Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo, but with MK characters and Stage fatalities), and the increasingly boring and freaquently dry Konquest mode make a mountain out of the replay value, the core gameplay is just as hard to get used to as in the last game.

  I miss what MK 4 used to be, which was in my opinion the best of the series, which basically proves what most gamers (hopefully) believe, it's the gameplay not the graphics.  The one thing I could do without is the Krypt, which is annoying and tedious, and requires you to actually go through the ever dragging Konquest mode mentioned above. It basically takes you from the beginning of Mortal Kombat to the current story of Deception as Shujinko, and gives you a better understanding of how Onaga, the Dragon King (Cheep Boss) resurrected and tricked the nutty old narrator (Shujinko) of the opening sequence (breathtaking), all just to collect stupid ""Krypt keys"" that unlock stages and characters, which by the way are awesome and make the nostalgia factor go through the roof.  All in all, the obligation of Konquest mode makes unlocking the characters seem more like a dragging job than a fun and rewarding experience.

  The core gameplay isn't what it's cracked up to be, as said earlier, not much was changed from Deadly Alliance. If you loved Deadly Alliance, though, you're in luck.  They did add one more fatality per character, making 2 for each, and probably the coolest addition to Mortal Kombat, Hara-Kiri's. That is basically a chance for you to kill yourself at the end of a lost match before your opponent does a fatality on you, making it sort-of a race to see who can do a fatality first, and still giving you a chance to control your character after you've lost.  Classic stages like the Pit 1, the Dead Pool and the Living Forest make a return and are looking prettier than ever. The return of Ermak, Nightwolf, Baraka, Milleena, Sindel and Noob-Smoke, the tag-team version of Noob-Siabot and Smoke.  Each of them seemlessly change out like switching fighting styles, but they have no weapon.  Those classic characters are definetly something to look forward to!

  The graphics are the best in the series and some of the best I've seen the PS2 put out, and immensly impressive when juxtaposed to the august visuals of Tekken 5 and VF4 Evolution.  The characters have an almost un-precedented amount of detail, and the stages are vast and, surprisingly vibrant considering the dark moodiness that MK games have delivered since MK2, but that's not a bad thing, especially since it shows off how awesome the game looks. The sound, however, is definetly this games knight in shining armor, but as long as they don't get rid of Dan ""Toasty"" Forden, nobody has anything to worry about.

  The Premium Packs for (Sub-Zero for PS2 and Mileena, Baraka, Scorpion and Raiden for XBOX), includes a serialized metal trading card of the character on the cover and an extra disk with some behind-the-scenes-esque footage of most of the characters and an arcade-perfect port of The One that started it all, baby! Other fighting games take note.

  Mortal Kombat Deception is great and delivers the bloody Kombat that people have come to expect and love, although it's just in need of an overhaul gameplay-wise, it's still well-deserving of all the hype it has recieved and fans should definetly not have to think twice before making a purchace!",4.0,B0002TG3Z0,Fatality!,Video Games

"It's decent for the price, It's very comfortable and nicely built. It has decent sound quality and a touch of sound cancelling...just a touch. Sadly, sounds does leak the higher the volume is. I went through two different pairs of Turtlebeach Z11's that had sound leaking so I'm used to it but it's not favorable.

Unlike the sound quality being decent the mic on the other hand is kinda awful. At first it's like your mic can't be picked up. You have to raise the volume and boost level, every single time you enable it. The worst part is that there is static in the background of the mic. It sounds like a fan in the distance. It doesn't matter if you have one on or not, you will hear this static regardless and raising the volume and boost only hightens it. I would not recommend the mic for recording. Honestly, I wouldn't even recommend it for Skype as the static could annoy some people. I'd only recommend it for communicating in games, especially games like MGS V that don't have a push-to-talk button.

 Facts are it is a good keyboard with really nice build quality. The software however at this point is not that functional IF you want all its features so it sadly may be a deal breaker for some. The video is just to give you a bit more of a feel for the product that product pictures cant. The backlighting is a bit brighter than show in darker environments I filmed most of that in the afternoon and dusk. I did the mouse and keyboard together since I have a life outside of Amazon reviews and figured I could kill two birds with a lone stone.

 I really only need the ability to remap buttons to specific colors and I can get it to do that fine. The config needed to update the keyboard at least for that takes fine and works as it should so for me the keyboard does all it has to do in terms of backlighting.

 In some of the other modes they simply do not work and upload correctly. The splash mode for instance only allows red backlighting as a starting color despite giving the option for other colors. This is a bit of a downer as I am not a fan of rainbow modes but I found this one to be pretty cool if I could have set the starting color to something other than red. Likewise the volume dial (very cool btw!) and function keys are hard wired red which is a bit abrasive if your going for a cooler tone profile, but less of an issue if you run the full color gamut like me.

 OK with that out of the way we do have a keyboard with plenty of potential and in fact it is very good. Cherry brown switches and an nice metal / plastic build that is a major step up from gaming keyboards of lesser ilk. Hand rest is nice and it will even act as a sound card if you swing that way though I didn't test it.

 I had no issue with usb mouse pass through but I only tried it on a Ripjaws mouse and a ergonomic mouse that I just got. Both worked without issue and I was able to game (Old star wars games mostly for me with KB mouse) and type / use the net without an issue. Im not a frequent gamer due to hand issue but I do like using the KB and mouse for older FPS games and use a gamepad for most recent games.

 Keys are a personal preference I don't like typing on mechanical keys for the most part but plenty do without issue. These either come in red or brown cherries and keyboard aficionados will be able to tell the difference but its a bit more subtle if you don't have a specific preference especially between reds / browns (blues are far more obvious). Hopefully the video gives you a decent idea of the click it makes and keep in mind this is the 'brown' variant.

 Its a really nice and stylish keyboard. Software isn't quite there balance that up and see if your in for that as it has been out for a while and there still seems to be a few gremlins. How one could excuse that aspect entirely is beyond me hence why I am ducking it a star and feel if its important to you then you will likely duck it another. As a personal choice the ability to program a custom key color is all I need and that works fine. I have no friends, so no need to impress anyone with the other modes etc. YMMV.

"The Madden and NCAA Football series have both been criticized for their lack of innovation upon release of the next iteration of the game for years now; NCAA Football 11 did some to change that perception, but NCAA Football 12 kept the same outward appearance, although it did change some gameplay features on the inside. In place of another major overhaul, however, NCAA 13 opted for some new features and animations, making the game more immersive than ever, but doing little to change the game's usual formula.

The new feature this year is Heisman challenge, a glorified Road to Glory mode that allows the player to step in to the shoes of a former Heisman Trophy winner such as Desmond Howard, Barry Sanders, or Charlie Ward, and compete in seasons on any team you wish. Inevitably this will lead to some disgusting combinations, such as Archie Griffin on Michigan or Carson Palmer on Notre Dame, but dwelling on that will only make matters worse. The Heisman Challenge's staple is reaction time, or bullet time, slowing down the game so the player can make cuts or throws with their head instead of quick reactions. In some cases, this is extremely helpful, but it also makes gameplay a little too easy at some levels. Heisman Challenge is definitely something to check out, but it won't keep you entertained for too long.

Dynasty has also seen some under the hood improvements. New recruiting options and features make each game in the season more important, as an underdog win over a top 25 opponent will net you some well-earned popularity with the recruits. This is a very welcome addition, and something which many have been wishing was part of the game for a while. More recruiting options are available for the player as well; Scouting is now an essential part of recruiting. You can see a player's ratings through the season, and target recruits based on your findings instead of being given a base grade. Calling recruits also leads to new gameplay options, and can help swing a recruit towards your school, if you're good enough. In game studio updates, provided by Rece Davis, improve the game's ESPN atmosphere, making it feel even more like you're watching the big game on television; the ESPN ticker gives you the scores from around the nation, and priority score alerts make it even easier to follow the big upsets of the heavy hitting game between top 5 teams.

Road to Glory saw some minor attention this year adding in new challenges as a college player. Despite the lack of a major overhaul it is still as fun as ever; leading your own high school player to the starting spot on a college team is extremely exciting. RTG may even be a little more difficult this year if you choose. It also touts the new reaction time used in the Heisman challenge, and contains better goals to pursue than past iterations, creating a more challenging game.

EA is touting the new animations that have been added to the game, with new receiving and throwing animations being brought into the game to improve realism, and motion blur being added as well. The new animations make the game more lifelike to be sure, and make the players look and feel more athletic, instead of moving about the field in a fashion similar to robots attempting to play American football. Motion blur never seems to be an integral part of the game, however, only popping up on replays and in between plays. Fans do have motion blur, but that seems less important than introducing motion blur in gameplay, and seeing a fan pump their fist with motion blur never made me gaze in wonder at the feat that EA achieved.  Defenses are not the omnipotent beasts they once were, and neither are receivers, for that matter. You need to make sure a receiver is looking for the ball before you throw to them, made easier by the grayed out icons that indicate your receiver is entirely oblivious to the fact you are attempting to throw them the ball. However, defensive players that aren't looking can't block the pass either, a problem that reoccurred throughout NCAA 12.

The biggest lacking feature for this year's NCAA football was the Infinity engine offered by Madden 13. Now, Madden 13 has not come out yet, and thus there has been no clear reference for its engine, giving us no clue whether it is another useless ""innovation"" provided by Madden or if it's actually a fantastic addition for the game, but it certainly is disappointing that it was not included in this year's NCAA. This is especially disappointing given that, at least in recent years, NCAA had surpassed Madden in being the elite football title produced by EA in terms of gameplay and reception.

The previous iteration of NCAA Football didn't do too much to separate itself from the line of other NCAA's, at least not in a manner similar to NCAA 11, and NCAA 13 doesn't do too much either.  For fans of college football and folks who have picked up each and every other game before it, it's a good buy, but for those simply looking for a recommendation to upgrade from NCAA 12, there's not much reason to spend the extra money for a the Heisman Challenge, new animations, and a roster update. As an individual who spent hundreds of hours on NCAA 12, I picked it up and loved it.

EDIT: I have recently had a lot of trouble loading my dynasty, as it constantly freezes during the game loading screen. I haven't been able to touch my dynasty mode after this, and it's extremely frustrating. Hopefully it will be patched soon, but as of now, with dynasty mode unable to be played correctly, I switch my position to don't buy.

"I'm a huge fan of WWII shooters, and if you are too, you should buy this game without reservation.  It's loads of fun, and you play different battles for a change.  I'll list some good and bad below.

Bad Stuff:

1) Short: As other reviews have noted, I was surprised by the short game time.  I wasn't paying attention, but I beat in two days (let's say 10 hours of play, tops).  After finishing the epic Half Life 2 lately, this was pretty bad.

2) Not much of a sequel: This game seems to follow the Halo 2 system of sequels.  Much as Halo 2 really was just a short, over hyped attempt at a massive Halo online game (and just a short, cheap rehashing of the first Halo for the single player), COD2 feels the same.  The multiplayer is a BLAST, but it feels like that was the real design here instead of the single player stuff.

Middle Ground Stuff:

1) Graphics: The graphics aren't bad, but they didn't blow me away. I liked the look of it, but again, recent efforts are a leap ahead of this graphically.  The smoke effects are AWESOME and very helpful for game play, so the game isn't without innovation, but they lacked the crisp texture of Half Life 2 (not to be a fanboy).

2) Linear Game Play: Some reviewers are complaining about linear game play.  Well, guess what, it's a shooter with a story line, so I didn't expect anything different.  You have to follow certain cues.  The levels are rather large with a short load time, and if they were more expansive or the story harder to follow, the game play would suffer.  The action is great, and the objectives are always crystal clear, so no complaints about the linear game play.  I hate shooters where I'm wandering around wondering what to do next, and this never happened here.  I always knew where to go, and if linear game play is the price I pay, it's a welcome price.  This genre doesn't lean to open ended game play, so I think this like complaining there's not enough violence in a romantic comedy.

3) AI: The AI is mixed.  At times, you get pre-generated Nazis perched out waiting to ambush you, but sometimes if you charge a building, the flank you and pull off some nasty surprises.  If you charge the same building on a re-play, you'll not they use totally different tactics.  Even throwing grenades isn't a sure thing since sometimes they throw back.  You get a mix of good and bad AI here pending on the level and circumstance.

Good Stuff:

1) Health System: COD2 avoids the unrealistic magical health packs that heal you and put you back in the fray perfectly healthy (where's the realism there?!).  Instead, you can suffer a certain amount of damage right away and still live.  If it's too much damage all at once, you die (a grenade, a torso or head shot, etc).  However, if it's a small wound, your vision gets screwy, and your aim gets worse, and you recoup in a few seconds if you can take cover.  Repeated hits, though, and you die on the spot.  It enhances the crouch, lay, stand system by making cover make a real difference.  It feels rather like a Halo ""force field"" system, and it works well.  Instead of watching a health bar and scrounging for band aids, you use your head and stay frosty, and you'll survive a firefight.  The health system makes you think instead of waste time doubling back for that health pack you left at the Nazi desk three building back.  Well done, great game play.

2) New Battles: While staples such as Stalingrad and D-Day are there, you play a different part of those battles.  You do a lot of the African campaign and some unique European battles you haven't done before.  The battles on Hill 402 at the bunker are pretty awesome.  I've seldom been as engaged by a WWII shooter as I was killing mortar teams and fighting a mounting Nazi advance, scrounging for ammo during brief lulls.  Well done.

Overall, this game is great.  It's short, so you may wait for it to drop 10 bucks, but the online play more than makes up for the brief nature of the single player.  If you're a WWII shooter fan, this is a must for your collection.  You'll have a good time and enjoy some COD2 mechanics.",4.0,B000ARJ1RQ,"Great Shooter, here is the good and the bad",Video Games

"Blizzard essentially did the equivalent of a patch. Balance fixes, loot drop fixes etc. removed the auction house (that no one wanted to begin with), removed always online DRM (again that no one wanted), re-introduced LAN equivalent play and talked about it as if was the most ground breaking thing in gaming when they've had it in their games since Warcraft 2. And this patch, Diablo 3.5, is being sold at retail price...*slow clap*. Bravo.",1.0,B00BGA9V2Q,Not worth retail,Video Games
